# Compatibility Issues with Excel Add-ins

## Overview

Excel add-in compatibility issues arise when add-ins work incorrectly or fail to function due to incompatibilities with Excel versions, operating systems, or other software components. These issues can occur after upgrades, in mixed environments, or with newly installed add-ins. This document covers the identification, diagnosis, and resolution of various compatibility issues affecting Excel add-ins.
