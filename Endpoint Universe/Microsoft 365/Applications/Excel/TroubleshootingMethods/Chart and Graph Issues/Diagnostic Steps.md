## Systematic Diagnosis Process

### Step 1: Verify Excel Baseline Functionality

1. **Launch Excel in Safe Mode**
   - Hold Ctrl key while launching Excel
   - Or use command: `excel.exe /safe`
   - Determine if issue persists in Safe Mode

2. **Test with Default Excel Configuration**
   - Reset Excel settings: `excel.exe /r`
   - Test in a clean user profile on the same machine
   - Document behavior differences between normal and clean configurations

3. **Check Excel without Add-ins**
   - Manually disable all add-ins through Excel interface
   - Test chart functionality without any add-ins active
   - Document performance and behavior changes

### Step 2: Chart Isolation Testing

1. **New Workbook Testing**
   - Create a new blank workbook
   - Create a simple test chart with minimal data
   - Test the same functionality that exhibits issues
   - Compare behavior with the problematic chart

2. **Chart Recreation**
   - In the original workbook, create a new chart with the same data
   - Apply the same formatting and customizations
   - Compare behavior with the problematic chart
   - Note any differences in behavior

3. **Data Set Reduction**
   - Create a simplified version of the chart with minimal data
   - Gradually increase complexity until the issue appears
   - Identify the specific data characteristics that trigger the problem
   - Document the minimum reproduction case

### Step 3: Chart-Specific Diagnostics

1. **Chart Data Range Verification**
   - Check source data ranges for accuracy
   - Verify that data ranges are contiguous and properly structured
   - Test alternative data selection methods
   - Examine hidden rows or columns affecting the chart

2. **Chart Elements Examination**
   - Systematically check each chart element:
     - Axes (scale, format, visibility)
     - Data series (values, order, format)
     - Labels and legends (text, position, format)
     - Titles and annotations (content, position)
   - Disable elements one by one to isolate problematic components

3. **Chart Format and Style Analysis**
   - Reset chart to default formatting
   - Apply standard styles and themes
   - Test with different color schemes
   - Examine custom formatting effects

4. **Interactive Feature Testing**

2. **Chart XML Examination**
   - For persistent issues, extract and examine chart XML
   - Look for corruption or unusual code in XML structure
   - Compare with XML from a working chart
   - Identify specific elements that differ

3. **Macro and Event Analysis**
   - Check for event-driven code affecting the chart
   - Review any macros that modify or interact with charts
   - Test with macros disabled
   - Examine workbook and worksheet events

4. **File Format Testing**
   - Save workbook in different Excel formats (.xlsx, .xlsm, .xlsb)
   - Test behavior in each format
   - Check for file corruption indicators
   - Attempt file recovery procedures if corruption is suspected
