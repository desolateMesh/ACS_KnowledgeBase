# Excel Formula Errors and Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview
This directory contains comprehensive documentation on common Excel formula errors, how to identify them, troubleshoot them, and implement best practices to prevent them. Each error type is documented in its own file with detailed examples, solutions, and prevention strategies.

## Formula Error Types

### Value Errors
- [#VALUE! Error](VALUE_Error.md) - Occurs when a formula contains the wrong type of argument or operand
- [#REF! Error](REF_Error.md) - Occurs when a formula refers to a cell or range that isn't valid or no longer exists
- [#DIV/0! Error](DIV0_Error.md) - Occurs when a formula attempts to divide by zero or an empty cell
- [#NAME? Error](NAME_Error.md) - Occurs when Excel doesn't recognize a name or text within a formula
- [#NULL! Error](NULL_Error.md) - Occurs when a formula uses the intersection operator between non-intersecting ranges
- [#NUM! Error](NUM_Error.md) - Occurs when a formula contains numeric values that aren't valid for the operation
