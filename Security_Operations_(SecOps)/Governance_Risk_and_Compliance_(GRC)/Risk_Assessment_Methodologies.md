# Risk Assessment Methodologies

## Overview

Risk assessment is a critical component of any comprehensive security operations program. This document provides detailed methodologies for conducting risk assessments that align with industry standards and best practices.

### Purpose

The purpose of risk assessment methodologies is to:
- Systematically identify and evaluate threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts
- Provide quantitative and qualitative measures of risk
- Enable informed decision-making about risk treatment options
- Support compliance with regulatory requirements
- Optimize resource allocation for security controls

### Key Principles

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Assess all relevant assets, threats, and vulnerabilities
2. **Consistency**: Apply standardized methods across the organization
3. **Repeatability**: Document processes to enable periodic reassessments
4. **Stakeholder Involvement**: Engage business owners and technical experts
5. **Business Alignment**: Consider business objectives and risk appetite

## Risk Assessment Frameworks

### NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)

The NIST RMF provides a structured approach to risk assessment:

1. **Prepare**: Establish context and organizational risk management strategy
2. **Categorize**: Classify information systems and data based on impact levels
3. **Select**: Choose appropriate security controls
4. **Implement**: Deploy security controls
5. **Assess**: Evaluate control effectiveness
6. **Authorize**: Make risk-based decisions
7. **Monitor**: Maintain ongoing awareness of security posture

#### Implementation Example

```yaml
nist_rmf_implementation:
  phase_1_prepare:
    - Define organizational roles and responsibilities
    - Establish risk management strategy
    - Identify organizational risk tolerance
    - Document system boundaries and interfaces
  
  phase_2_categorize:
    - Identify information types processed
    - Determine impact levels (Low, Moderate, High) for:
      - Confidentiality
      - Integrity
      - Availability
    - Document system categorization
  
  phase_3_select:
    - Apply baseline controls from NIST SP 800-53
    - Tailor controls based on organizational requirements
    - Document control selection rationale
```

### ISO 27005 Information Security Risk Management

ISO 27005 provides guidance on:

1. **Context Establishment**: Define risk criteria and assessment scope
2. **Risk Identification**: Identify assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts
3. **Risk Analysis**: Determine likelihood and consequences
4. **Risk Evaluation**: Compare against risk criteria
5. **Risk Treatment**: Select and implement options
6. **Risk Monitoring and Review**: Track changes and effectiveness

#### Risk Register Template

}
```

### FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk)

FAIR provides a quantitative approach to risk assessment:

1. **Identify Scenario Components**
   - Asset at risk
   - Threat community
   - Type of loss

2. **Evaluate Loss Event Frequency (LEF)**
   - Threat Event Frequency (TEF)
   - Vulnerability (VULN)
   - LEF = TEF × VULN

3. **Evaluate Loss Magnitude (LM)**
   - Primary Loss
   - Secondary Loss

4. **Derive Risk**
   - Risk = LEF × LM

#### FAIR Calculation Example

```python
# FAIR Risk Calculation Example
def calculate_fair_risk(threat_event_frequency, vulnerability, primary_loss, secondary_loss):
    """
    Calculate risk using FAIR methodology
    
    Parameters:
    threat_event_frequency (float): Annual rate of threat events
    vulnerability (float): Probability of successful attack (0-1)
    primary_loss (float): Direct financial impact
    secondary_loss (float): Indirect financial impact
    
    Returns:
    dict: Risk metrics
    """
    loss_event_frequency = threat_event_frequency * vulnerability
    loss_magnitude = primary_loss + secondary_loss
    annual_loss_expectancy = loss_event_frequency * loss_magnitude
    
    return {
        "loss_event_frequency": loss_event_frequency,
        "loss_magnitude": loss_magnitude,
        "annual_loss_expectancy": annual_loss_expectancy,
        "risk_rating": categorize_risk(annual_loss_expectancy)
    }

def categorize_risk(ale):
    if ale >= 1000000:
        return "Critical"
    elif ale >= 500000:
        return "High"
    elif ale >= 100000:
        return "Medium"
    else:
        return "Low"

# Example Usage
risk_metrics = calculate_fair_risk(
    threat_event_frequency=12,  # Monthly attempts
    vulnerability=0.1,          # 10% success rate
    primary_loss=100000,        # Direct costs
    secondary_loss=400000       # Reputation damage, legal costs
)
```

#### Qualitative Risk Analysis

```markdown
# Risk Matrix Configuration

## Likelihood Levels
1. **Rare** (1): Less than once in 5 years
2. **Unlikely** (2): Once in 2-5 years
3. **Possible** (3): Once per year
4. **Likely** (4): Multiple times per year
5. **Almost Certain** (5): Monthly or more frequently

## Impact Levels
1. **Negligible** (1): < $10,000; minimal business disruption
2. **Minor** (2): $10,000 - $100,000; some business disruption
3. **Moderate** (3): $100,000 - $1M; significant disruption
4. **Major** (4): $1M - $10M; major business impact
5. **Catastrophic** (5): > $10M; business-threatening impact

## Risk Rating Matrix
```

| Likelihood | Negligible (1) | Minor (2) | Moderate (3) | Major (4) | Catastrophic (5) |
|------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|------------------|
| Almost Certain (5) | Medium (5) | High (10) | High (15) | Critical (20) | Critical (25) |
| Likely (4) | Low (4) | Medium (8) | High (12) | Critical (16) | Critical (20) |
| Possible (3) | Low (3) | Medium (6) | Medium (9) | High (12) | High (15) |
| Unlikely (2) | Low (2) | Low (4) | Medium (6) | Medium (8) | High (10) |
| Rare (1) | Low (1) | Low (2) | Low (3) | Low (4) | Medium (5) |

```
## Risk Rating Definitions
- **Critical** (16-25): Immediate action required
- **High** (10-15): Action required within 30 days
- **Medium** (5-9): Action required within 90 days
- **Low** (1-4): Accept or monitor
```

### Risk Treatment Options

   - Apply safeguards to reduce impact
   - Deploy detection and response capabilities

3. **Risk Transfer**
   - Purchase cyber insurance
   - Outsource to third parties
   - Contractual risk allocation

4. **Risk Acceptance**
   - Document acceptance decision
   - Define monitoring requirements
   - Set review intervals

## Risk Assessment Best Practices

### 1. Establish Clear Governance

```yaml
governance_structure:
  executive_sponsor: "Chief Information Security Officer"
  
  risk_committee:
    chair: "Deputy CISO"

        self.monitoring_config = {
            'critical': {'frequency': 'real-time', 'alerting': True},
            'high': {'frequency': 'daily', 'alerting': True},
            'medium': {'frequency': 'weekly', 'alerting': False},
            'low': {'frequency': 'monthly', 'alerting': False}
        }
