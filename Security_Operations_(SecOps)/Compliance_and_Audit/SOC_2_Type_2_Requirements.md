# SOC 2 Type 2 Requirements

## Executive Summary

SOC 2 Type 2 (Service Organization Control 2 Type 2) is a framework for managing customer data based on five Trust Service Criteria (TSC): security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. This document provides comprehensive requirements, implementation guidelines, and best practices for achieving and maintaining SOC 2 Type 2 compliance.

## Overview

### What is SOC 2 Type 2?

SOC 2 Type 2 is an audit report that evaluates:
- **Design effectiveness**: Whether security controls are properly designed to meet trust service criteria
- **Operating effectiveness**: Whether these controls operate effectively over a period of time (typically 3-12 months)

### Key Differences from Type 1

| Aspect | Type 1 | Type 2 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Evaluation Period | Point in time | Over a period (3-12 months) |
| Testing | Design only | Design and operating effectiveness |
| Evidence Required | Current state | Historical records and logs |
| Audit Duration | 1-2 months | 3-12 months minimum |

### Why SOC 2 Type 2 Matters

- **Customer Trust**: Demonstrates ongoing commitment to security
- **Competitive Advantage**: Often required for enterprise contracts
- **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates security risks
- **Operational Excellence**: Improves internal processes and controls

## Trust Service Criteria

### 1. Security (Common Criteria)

The security principle is foundational and applies to all SOC 2 audits. It encompasses:

```markdown
Security Principle Components:
- Protection against unauthorized access (physical and logical)
- Protection against unauthorized disclosure of information
- Protection from system abuse
- Protection from theft, loss, or damage
- Incident detection and response
```

### 2. Availability

**Definition**: The system is available for operation and use as committed or agreed.

**Key Requirements**:
- Service Level Agreements (SLAs) must be defined and monitored
- Uptime monitoring and reporting
- Disaster recovery and business continuity planning
- Performance monitoring and capacity planning

**Example Controls**:
```yaml
availability_controls:
  - name: "High Availability Architecture"
    description: "Implement redundant systems and failover mechanisms"
    evidence_required:
      - Architecture diagrams
      - Failover test results
      - Uptime reports
      
  - name: "SLA Monitoring"
    description: "Monitor and report on SLA compliance"
    evidence_required:
      - SLA dashboards
      - Monthly availability reports
      - Incident response logs
```

### 3. Processing Integrity

**Definition**: System processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized.

**Key Requirements**:
- Data validation controls
- Processing accuracy verification
- Error detection and correction
- Transaction logging and monitoring

**Example Controls**:
```yaml
processing_integrity_controls:
  - name: "Data Validation"
    description: "Implement input validation for all data processing"
    implementation:
      - Schema validation
      - Type checking
      - Range validation
      - Format verification
    
  - name: "Transaction Integrity"
    description: "Ensure all transactions are atomic and consistent"
    implementation:
      - Database ACID compliance
      - Transaction rollback capability
      - Audit trail maintenance
```

### 4. Confidentiality

**Definition**: Information designated as confidential is protected as committed or agreed.

**Key Requirements**:
- Data classification framework
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Access controls based on classification
- Data retention and disposal policies

**Implementation Guide**:
```markdown
## Data Classification Framework

### Classification Levels:
1. **Public**: No restrictions on distribution
2. **Internal**: For internal use only
3. **Confidential**: Restricted to need-to-know basis
4. **Highly Confidential**: Requires additional protection measures

### Protection Requirements by Level:
- Public: Basic access logging
- Internal: Authentication required, activity monitoring
- Confidential: Encryption, role-based access, audit trails
- Highly Confidential: All above + MFA, segregated storage, enhanced monitoring
```

### 5. Privacy

**Definition**: Personal information is collected, used, retained, disclosed, and disposed of in conformity with the commitments in the entity's privacy notice.

**Key Requirements**:
- Privacy policy publication and accessibility
- Consent management
- Data subject rights implementation
- Cross-border data transfer compliance

**Privacy Controls Framework**:
```json
