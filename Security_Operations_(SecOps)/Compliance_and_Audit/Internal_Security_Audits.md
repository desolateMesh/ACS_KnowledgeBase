# Internal Security Audits

## Overview

Internal Security Audits are systematic evaluations of an organization's information security controls, policies, procedures, and practices conducted by internal resources or teams. These audits are essential for maintaining security posture, ensuring compliance, and identifying vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

## Purpose and Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Identify Security Gaps**: Discover vulnerabilities in systems, processes, and controls
2. **Ensure Compliance**: Verify adherence to internal policies and external regulations
3. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate and prioritize security risks
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Drive ongoing security enhancements
5. **Resource Validation**: Confirm proper allocation and utilization of security resources

### Key Benefits
- Early detection of security issues
- Cost-effective compared to external audits
- Better understanding of internal operations
- Rapid remediation of findings
- Preparation for external audits
- Enhanced security culture
