      "total_systems": 100,
      "coverage_percentage": 85
    },
    "findings": {
      "total_findings": 250,
      "critical_findings": 15,
      "high_findings": 50,

      "audits_per_quarter": 12,
      "avg_audit_duration": 5,
      "resource_utilization": 78
    }
  }
}
```

### Performance Indicators
1. **Audit Completion Rate**: Percentage of planned audits completed on schedule
2. **Finding Detection Rate**: Number of findings per audit hour
3. **Remediation Velocity**: Average time from finding to closure
4. **Risk Coverage**: Percentage of high-risk areas audited
5. **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Feedback scores from audit clients

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### 1. Scope Creep
**Problem**: Audit scope expands beyond original plan
**Solution**: 
- Define clear boundaries in audit charter
- Regular scope reviews with stakeholders
- Document any scope changes formally

### 2. Resistance to Audits
**Problem**: Departments view audits as punitive
**Solution**:
- Position audits as collaborative improvements
- Share positive findings alongside issues
- Involve teams in remediation planning

### 3. Resource Constraints
**Problem**: Limited staff and budget for audits
**Solution**:
- Prioritize based on risk assessment
- Leverage automation tools
- Cross-train team members
- Consider co-sourcing options
