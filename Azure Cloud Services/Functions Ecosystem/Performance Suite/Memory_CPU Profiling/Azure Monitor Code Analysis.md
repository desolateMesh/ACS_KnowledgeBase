## Analysis Techniques

### 1. CPU Analysis

Azure Monitor provides several methods to identify CPU-related issues:

#### High CPU Analysis

1. Navigate to Function App > Diagnose and Solve Problems
2. Select "Availability and Performance" 
3. Choose "CPU Analysis"
4. Review the CPU drill-down data to identify:
   - Overall CPU utilization patterns
   - Instance-specific CPU usage
   - Individual function contributions to CPU usage

#### CPU Hotspot Identification

For detailed analysis of CPU hotspots:

1. In Application Insights, navigate to "Performance" section
2. Select the function operation with high CPU usage
3. Click "Profiler Traces" to view code-level CPU analysis
4. Examine the flame graph to identify CPU-intensive code paths

### 2. Memory Analysis

To analyze memory issues in Function Apps:

#### Memory Usage Patterns

1. In Azure Monitor, create a custom dashboard with memory metrics
2. Add charts for MemoryWorkingSet and PrivateBytes
3. Configure time ranges to identify:
   - Memory growth patterns (potential leaks)
   - Memory spikes during specific operations
   - Correlation between memory usage and function execution

#### Memory Dump Analysis

For advanced memory troubleshooting:

1. Navigate to Function App > Diagnose and Solve Problems
2. Select "Diagnostic Tools"
3. Choose "Collect Memory Dump"
4. Analyze the memory dump for:
   - Large object allocations
   - Excessive garbage collection
   - Memory fragmentation

## Implementing Performance Improvements

### Based on Code Analysis Findings

After identifying performance issues through Azure Monitor Code Analysis, implement improvements:

1. **Optimize CPU Usage**:
   - Reduce computational complexity
   - Implement caching for repeated calculations
   - Use asynchronous operations appropriately
   - Consider parallelization for suitable workloads

2. **Improve Memory Management**:
   - Eliminate memory leaks
   - Implement object pooling
   - Optimize data structures
   - Reduce large object allocations

3. **Enhance Scaling Behavior**:
   - Adjust function timeout settings
   - Configure appropriate instance counts
   - Implement backoff strategies for retries
   - Consider Premium plan for CPU-intensive workloads

## Monitoring Workflows

### Proactive Monitoring

Implement these monitoring practices to catch issues before they impact users:

1. **Custom Dashboards**:
   - Create Azure Monitor dashboards for key function metrics
   - Set up side-by-side views of CPU, memory, and execution metrics
   - Include application-specific custom metrics

2. **Alert Configuration**:
   - Configure alerts for abnormal CPU/memory patterns
   - Set up dynamic thresholds based on historical performance
   - Create action groups to notify appropriate teams

### Reactive Analysis

When investigating reported performance issues:

1. **Live Metrics Stream**:
   - Use Application Insights Live Metrics to observe real-time behavior
   - Identify correlated metrics during issue occurrence
   - Monitor instance count and resource utilization in real-time

2. **Log Query Analysis**:
   - Create KQL queries to analyze function logs during issue periods
   - Correlate execution logs with performance metrics
   - Identify patterns in failed or throttled executions

## Advanced Analysis Techniques

### Scale Controller Analysis

The Azure Functions scale controller makes important decisions about scaling. Enable scale controller logging:

```
1. Add application setting SCALE_CONTROLLER_LOGGING_ENABLED=1
2. Configure diagnostic settings to route logs appropriately
3. Use KQL queries to analyze scale controller decision patterns
```

### Kusto Query Language (KQL) Examples

#### Query CPU Usage by Function:

```kusto
FunctionAppLogs
| where Category == "Function"
| summarize AvgCPU = avg(FunctionExecutionUnits) by FunctionName
| order by AvgCPU desc
```

#### Identify Memory Growth:

```kusto
metrics
| where name == "MemoryWorkingSet"
| summarize AvgMemory = avg(Average) by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| order by TimeGenerated asc
```

#### Analyze Execution Duration:

```kusto
FunctionAppLogs
| where Category == "Function"
| summarize AvgDuration = avg(DurationMs), MaxDuration = max(DurationMs) by FunctionName
| order by MaxDuration desc
```

## Best Practices

### Monitoring Strategy

1. **Establish Baselines**:
   - Capture performance metrics during normal operation
   - Document expected resource utilization patterns
   - Create baseline queries for future comparison

2. **Regular Performance Reviews**:
   - Schedule periodic reviews of function performance
   - Compare current metrics against established baselines
   - Identify gradually degrading patterns

3. **Holistic Monitoring**:
   - Monitor both Azure Functions and dependent services
   - Track end-to-end transaction performance
   - Implement custom metrics for business-specific insights

### Optimization Workflow

1. **Prioritize Issues**:
   - Focus on high-impact performance bottlenecks first
   - Consider both frequency and severity of issues
   - Evaluate business impact of performance problems

2. **Incremental Improvements**:
   - Implement changes in small, measurable increments
   - Validate improvements through A/B testing
   - Document performance gains for each optimization

3. **Continuous Learning**:
   - Share performance insights across development teams
   - Build a knowledge base of common patterns and solutions
   - Incorporate performance considerations into development process

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue | Detection Method | Potential Solutions |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|
| Memory Leaks | Growing MemoryWorkingSet over time | Identify objects not being garbage collected, implement using blocks for disposable resources |
| CPU Spikes | High CPUPercentage metrics | Profile code, identify compute-intensive operations, implement caching or async processing |
| Slow Cold Starts | Long FunctionExecutionTime on first executions | Use Premium plan with pre-warmed instances, optimize initialization code |
| Excessive GC Pauses | Inconsistent execution times, memory pressure | Reduce object allocations, implement object pooling, optimize data structures |
| Instance Thrashing | Frequent scale-in/scale-out operations | Adjust scale settings, implement more consistent workload patterns |
