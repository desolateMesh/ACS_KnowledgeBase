# Canary Deployment Templates for Azure

## Overview

Canary deployment is a risk mitigation strategy for software updates that involves gradually rolling out changes to a small subset of users or servers before deploying to the entire infrastructure. This approach allows teams to test new features in a production environment with minimal impact if issues arise, effectively serving as an early warning system (like a "canary in a coal mine").

## Key Benefits

- **Reduced Risk**: Limiting new version exposure to a small user subset minimizes the impact of potential issues
- **Early Detection**: Problems can be identified before affecting the entire user base
- **Real-World Testing**: Provides validation in actual production environments with real user traffic
- **Cost Efficiency**: Requires less infrastructure compared to blue/green deployments
- **Innovation Enablement**: Allows teams to experiment with features safely
- **Immediate Feedback**: Gathers real user feedback on new functionality quickly

## Azure Implementation Options

### 1. Azure DevOps Pipeline-Based Canary Deployment

Azure DevOps provides built-in support for canary deployment strategies within release pipelines:

```yaml
jobs:
- deployment: DeployWebApp
  environment: production
  strategy:
    canary:
      increments: [10, 20, 70]
      preDeploy:
        steps:
        - script: echo Initialize canary deployment
      deploy:
        steps:
        - script: echo Deploy to canary environment
      routeTraffic:
        steps:
        - script: echo Routing traffic to canary
      postRouteTraffic:
        steps:
        - script: echo Monitoring canary health
      on:
        failure:
          steps:
          - script: echo Rollback canary deployment
        success:
          steps:
          - script: echo Complete canary deployment
```

### 2. Azure App Service Slots

For web applications, Azure App Service slots provide an elegant canary implementation:

1. Create a staging slot (canary environment)
2. Deploy new code to the staging slot
3. Use Traffic Manager or Azure Front Door to route a percentage of traffic to the staging slot
4. Monitor performance and errors
5. Gradually increase traffic percentage or perform a slot swap if successful

### 3. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

For containerized applications running on AKS:

1. Deploy the new version alongside the existing version
2. Use Kubernetes services and ingress controllers to split traffic
3. Utilize tools like Flagger for automated canary analysis
4. Gradually shift traffic based on success metrics

## Best Practices for Azure Canary Deployments

### Planning and Setup

1. **Define Success Metrics**: Establish clear performance thresholds that determine whether the deployment proceeds or rolls back
2. **Proper Segmentation**: Select appropriate user segments for initial canary testing (consider geography, device types, or random sampling)
3. **Feature Flags**: Implement feature flag systems to enable/disable features without redeploying code
4. **Isolation Mechanisms**: Ensure canary failures don't cascade to affect the entire system

### Implementation

1. **Progressive Increments**: Use small, incremental traffic shifts (e.g., 5%, 10%, 20%, 50%, 100%)
2. **Appropriate Bake Time**: Allow sufficient time between increments to observe behavior (typically 15-30 minutes)
3. **Automate Rollbacks**: Configure automatic rollback triggers based on predefined thresholds
4. **Shared Database Considerations**: Be cautious with database schema changes during canary deployments

### Monitoring and Analysis

1. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Implement robust monitoring with Azure Monitor and Application Insights
2. **Custom Health Probes**: Create application-specific health endpoints 
3. **Alert Configuration**: Set up proactive alerts for key performance metrics
4. **Log Analytics**: Utilize Azure Log Analytics for centralized logging and analysis
5. **Dashboard Visibility**: Create dashboards specifically for tracking canary deployment health

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

stages:
- stage: Build
  jobs:
  - job: BuildContainer
    steps:
    - script: echo Building and pushing container

        deploy:
          steps:
          - task: Kubernetes@1
            inputs:
              connectionType: 'Azure Resource Manager'
              azureSubscriptionEndpoint: 'Your-Subscription'
              azureResourceGroup: 'YourResourceGroup'
              kubernetesCluster: 'YourAKSCluster'
              command: 'apply'
              arguments: '-f canary-deployment.yaml'
        routeTraffic:
          steps:
          - task: Kubernetes@1
            inputs:
              connectionType: 'Azure Resource Manager'
              azureSubscriptionEndpoint: 'Your-Subscription'
              azureResourceGroup: 'YourResourceGroup'
              kubernetesCluster: 'YourAKSCluster'
              command: 'apply'
              arguments: '-f canary-service.yaml'
        postRouteTraffic:
          steps:
          - script: |
              # Monitor pod health and metrics
              kubectl get pods -l app=yourapp,version=canary
              # Wait for monitoring period
              sleep 300
```

## Integration with Azure Monitoring

Effective monitoring is critical for canary deployments. Integrate your templates with Azure Monitor to track:

1. **Performance Metrics**: Response times, CPU usage, memory usage
2. **Error Rates**: HTTP errors, exceptions, failed requests
3. **User Behavior**: Session duration, bounce rates, conversion metrics
4. **Custom Business Metrics**: Transaction success, order completion rates

## Common Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Database schema changes | Use schema versioning or implement backward compatibility |
| Session persistence during traffic shifts | Implement sticky sessions or session sharing |
| Inconsistent user experience | Utilize feature flags to control feature visibility |
| Monitoring signal noise | Define clear baseline metrics and use statistical analysis |
| Rollback complexity | Create comprehensive rollback plans with automated triggers |
