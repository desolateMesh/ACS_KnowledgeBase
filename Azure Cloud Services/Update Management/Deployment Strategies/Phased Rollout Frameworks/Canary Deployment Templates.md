# Canary Deployment Templates for Azure Update Manager

## Overview

Canary deployments represent a risk-mitigation strategy where updates are initially applied to a small subset of systems before broader deployment. This approach allows organizations to detect potential issues with minimal impact. This document provides templates and guidance for implementing canary deployment strategies with Azure Update Manager.

## Canary Deployment Fundamentals

### Key Concepts

- **Canary Group**: A small, representative subset of systems that receive updates first
- **Observation Period**: Time allocated to monitor canary systems for issues before wider deployment
- **Success Criteria**: Predefined metrics that must be satisfied to proceed with broader rollout
- **Rollback Procedure**: Clear process to restore canary systems if issues are detected

## Implementation in Azure Update Manager

### Template 1: Basic Canary Deployment

#### Configuration

1. **Resource Grouping**:
   - Create a resource group named `[Environment]-Canary-RG` (e.g., `Prod-Canary-RG`)
   - Select 5-10% of production systems ensuring representation across:
     - Hardware configurations
     - Workload types
     - Geographic distribution

2. **Deployment Sequence**:
   ```
   Canary Group → Observation Period (24-48 hours) → Wave 1 (25%) → Wave 2 (75%)
   ```

3. **Azure Update Manager Configuration**:
   - Create three update management schedules:
