# Maintenance Window Configurations

## Overview

This document outlines best practices, guidelines, and configurations for implementing effective maintenance windows within Azure Update Manager. Properly configured maintenance windows are critical for ensuring system updates occur with minimal business impact while maintaining security and compliance requirements.

## Maintenance Window Fundamentals

### Definition and Purpose

A maintenance window defines a specific time period during which update activities are allowed to occur on target systems. In Azure Update Manager, maintenance windows serve several key purposes:

1. **Controlled Timing**: Define exactly when updates can be applied to systems
2. **Business Impact Minimization**: Schedule updates during low-usage periods
3. **Risk Management**: Limit update activities to known, monitored periods
4. **Resource Utilization Optimization**: Balance update loads across infrastructure
5. **Compliance Management**: Ensure timely application of security patches

### Key Components

Every maintenance window configuration consists of several critical components:

1. **Duration**: The length of time allowed for update activities
2. **Schedule**: When and how frequently the window occurs
3. **Scope**: Which systems are affected by the window
4. **Update Classification**: Types of updates permitted during the window
5. **Reboot Behavior**: How system restarts are handled
6. **Resource Targeting**: Selection criteria for affected systems

## Maintenance Window Types

### Guest OS Maintenance Windows

These maintenance windows apply to operating system updates for Azure VMs and Arc-enabled servers:

1. **Configuration Parameters**:
   - Minimum maintenance window: 1 hour 30 minutes
   - Maximum maintenance window: 3 hours 55 minutes
   - Repeats value: At least 6 hours between windows
   - Start time: Must be at least 15 minutes after creation
   - Scope: Windows and Linux systems

2. **Implementation Requirements**:
   - VM patch orchestration must be set to AutomaticByPlatform (Azure-orchestrated)
   - For Azure VMs, patch orchestration property must be set to Customer Managed Schedules
   - Not a requirement for Arc-enabled servers

### Host Maintenance Windows

These apply to platform updates that don't require a restart:

1. **Configuration Parameters**:
   - Window period: Anytime within 35 days
   - Minimum window: 2 hours
   - Automatic application after 35 days
   - Scope: Isolated VMs, isolated VM scale sets, dedicated hosts

2. **Implementation Notes**:
   - Rack-level maintenance not currently supported
   - Available for Azure dedicated hosts

### OS Image Maintenance Windows

These apply to OS disk upgrades in virtual machine scale sets:

1. **Configuration Parameters**:
   - Minimum window: 5 hours
   - Replaces OS disk with latest image version
   - Preserves data disks and runs extensions/custom scripts
   - Scope: Virtual machine scale sets

## Configuration Best Practices

### Duration Planning

1. **Appropriate Window Sizing**:
   - For routine patches: Minimum 2 hours recommended
   - For feature updates: Minimum 3 hours recommended
   - For complex environments: 3 hours 55 minutes (maximum) recommended

2. **Buffer Allocation**:
   - Allow 10-15 minutes buffer at the end of maintenance windows
   - For Windows systems: 10 minutes of window reserved for reboot operations
   - For Linux systems: 15 minutes of window reserved for reboot operations

3. **Update Type Considerations**:
   - Service packs require longer windows (up to 1 hour per SP)
   - Critical security updates average 10 minutes per update
   - Standard updates average 5-7 minutes per update

### Schedule Optimization

1. **Business-Aligned Timing**:
   - Schedule windows during documented low-usage periods
   - Avoid business hours for production systems
   - Consider global operations when setting window times
   - Align with existing change management processes

2. **Frequency Guidelines**:
   - Critical production systems: Monthly after thorough testing
   - Development/test systems: Weekly or bi-weekly
   - Security-focused systems: Align with Patch Tuesday (2nd Tuesday)
   - Set recurrence patterns appropriate to environment needs

3. **Staggered Deployments**:
   - Implement progressive deployment across environment tiers
   - Example progression: Dev → Test → Pre-production → Production
   - Maintain consistent delays between environment updates (e.g., 7-day intervals)
   - Use tag-based targeting to manage deployment waves

### High Availability Considerations

1. **Availability Set Management**:
   - Systems in the same availability set should not be updated simultaneously
   - Split machines across multiple maintenance windows
   - Stagger update domains to maintain service availability
   - Increase maintenance window duration if availability sets must share windows

2. **Region-Based Strategies**:
   - Stagger updates across paired regions
   - Primary region first, secondary region after verification
   - Use tags to designate region deployment order
   - Avoid cross-region simultaneous updates for critical services

## Implementation Guidelines

### Creating Maintenance Windows

The following process outlines the steps for creating effective maintenance windows:

1. **Planning Phase**:
   - Identify systems requiring updates
   - Determine appropriate window duration
   - Select optimal timing and frequency
