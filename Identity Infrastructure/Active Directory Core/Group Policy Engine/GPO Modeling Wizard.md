# GPO Modeling Wizard

## Overview
The Group Policy Modeling Wizard (GPMW) is a powerful administrative tool that allows IT professionals to simulate the application of Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to users and computers before actual deployment. This helps predict the effective policy settings that would be applied in different scenarios, reducing the risk of unexpected policy conflicts and troubleshooting time in production environments.

## Introduction to GPO Modeling

### What is GPO Modeling?
GPO Modeling is a simulation process that calculates the Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) for a user or computer based on:
- Group membership
- Organizational Unit (OU) placement
- WMI filters
- Security filtering
- Site location
- Slow link detection
- Loopback processing settings

Unlike actual policy application, modeling provides a "what-if" analysis without changing the production environment.

### Benefits of Policy Modeling
- Preemptive identification of policy conflicts
- Validation of complex policy designs
- Testing of OU restructuring scenarios
- Assessment of security-filtered policies
- Planning for user or computer migrations across OUs
- Predicting effects of loopback processing
- Identifying precedence issues in multiple policies
- Simulating site-based policy application

### Limitations of the Modeling Wizard
- Cannot simulate User Certificate Mapping
- Limited simulation of software installation
- Cannot fully predict Folder Redirection behavior in all scenarios
- Some authentication and security policies may not be accurately modeled
- Custom ADM/ADMX template results may vary in accuracy
- Does not account for local policies outside Active Directory

## Prerequisites and Setup

### System Requirements
- Windows Server with the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) installed
- Active Directory domain environment
- Appropriate administrative rights in the domain
- At minimum, read access to all GPOs in the domain

### Required Permissions
The following permissions are required to use the GPO Modeling Wizard effectively:
- Domain Admin or delegated rights to run the Modeling Wizard
- Read access to all GPOs in the domain
- Read access to User and Computer objects being modeled
- Read access to Active Directory container objects (OUs, domains)

### Installing the Required Tools
On Windows Server 2016/2019/2022:
```powershell
# Install GPMC through PowerShell
Install-WindowsFeature -Name GPMC

# Verify installation
Get-WindowsFeature GPMC
```

For Windows 10/11 administrative workstations:
1. Navigate to Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features
2. Select "Turn Windows features on or off"
3. Enable "Group Policy Management Tools" under "Remote Server Administration Tools" > "Feature Administration Tools"

## Using the GPO Modeling Wizard

### Accessing the Wizard
1. Open Group Policy Management Console (gpmc.msc)
2. Navigate to the forest or domain where you want to perform modeling
3. Right-click on "Group Policy Modeling" node
4. Select "Group Policy Modeling Wizard" from the context menu

### Basic Configuration Steps
1. **User and Computer Selection**:
   - Choose "User and Computer" simulation
   - Select the domain/container for user simulation
   - Select the domain/container for computer simulation
   - (Optionally) Specify a specific user or computer object

2. **Advanced Simulation Options**:
   - Configure slow link processing if needed
   - Set loopback processing mode (None, Merge, Replace)
   - Specify site name for location-based policy

3. **Alternate Active Directory Paths**:
   - Optionally select different OUs for the user and computer objects
   - Use for migration planning or OU restructuring testing

4. **Security Groups**:
   - Add or remove security groups for the simulated user/computer
   - Useful for testing security-filtered GPO effects without changing actual group memberships

5. **WMI Filters**:
   - Select WMI filters to include or exclude for simulation
   - Test filter impact on policy application

6. **Summary Review**:
   - Review all simulation parameters before executing
   - Confirm and run the simulation

### Practical Example Walkthrough
Let's simulate a standard scenario where a user in the "Marketing" OU is accessing a computer in the "Finance" OU (perhaps temporarily):

1. Start the GPO Modeling Wizard
2. Select the domain for both user and computer
3. For container selection:
   - User Container: "Marketing" OU
   - Computer Container: "Finance" OU
4. (Optional) Select a specific user like "jsmith" from the Marketing OU
5. Leave other options at defaults unless testing specific scenarios
6. Complete the wizard and review results

## Advanced Simulation Scenarios

### Cross-Domain Simulation
For environments with multiple domains, you can simulate a user from one domain accessing a computer in another domain:

1. In the User Selection page, choose the appropriate domain for the user
2. In the Computer Selection page, select the different domain
3. Continue with container/OU selections in each domain
4. Complete the simulation to see cross-domain policy results

### Testing Loopback Processing
To test User Policy Loopback Processing (critical for shared computer environments):

1. In the Advanced Simulation Options, set "Loopback Processing" to either:
   - **Merge mode**: Computer GPOs are applied in addition to user GPOs
   - **Replace mode**: Computer GPOs completely replace user GPOs
2. Run the simulation with specific computer OU containing the loopback GPOs
3. Examine the "User Data (Loopback)" section in results to see the effects

### Slow Link Detection Simulation
To test how policies behave over slow network connections:

1. In the Advanced Simulation Options, check "Slow network connection"
2. Run the simulation to see which policies are skipped or modified
3. Look for policies that are set to not be processed over slow links

### Security Filtering Tests
To determine the impact of security group membership on policy application:

1. In the Security Groups section, add/remove security groups for the simulation
2. Run the simulation with different combinations of groups
3. Compare results to identify which policies are security-filtered

### Site-Based Policy Testing
To test how policies apply based on site location:

1. In the Advanced Simulation Options, set the specific site name
2. Run the simulation to see site-linked GPOs in action
3. Review results to confirm site-based policy application

## Interpreting Results

### Understanding the Results Display
The simulation results are displayed in the GPMC with several key sections:

1. **Summary Information**:
   - Overview of the simulation settings
   - Time of execution and domain context

2. **Settings Tab**:
   - Hierarchical view of all policy settings
   - Organized by Computer Configuration and User Configuration
   - Each setting shows the winning GPO that defines it

3. **Query Tab**:
   - Filters for finding specific policies
   - Search capabilities for locating particular settings

### Key Results Sections to Analyze

#### Computer Configuration Results
This section shows all computer policies that would apply, including:
- Windows Settings (Security Settings, Scripts, etc.)
- Administrative Templates
- Software Installation
- Source GPO for each setting

#### User Configuration Results
This section shows all user policies that would apply, including:
- Windows Settings (Folder Redirection, Scripts, etc.)
- Administrative Templates
- Software Installation
- Source GPO for each setting

#### Denied GPOs
This critical section shows GPOs that were considered but not applied due to:
- Security filtering restrictions
- WMI filter conditions not met
- Access denied to the GPO
- Block inheritance in effect

#### GPO Precedence List
This shows the order in which GPOs were applied, with:
- Higher GPOs in the list overriding lower ones
- Clear indication of GPO link location
- Link order numbers at each level

### Identifying Policy Conflicts
One of the most important aspects of interpreting results is finding and resolving policy conflicts:

1. Look for settings that appear multiple times across different GPOs
2. Examine the "Winning GPO" column to identify which one takes precedence
3. Check the "Precedence" tab to understand the application order
4. Pay special attention to "Block Inheritance" and "Enforced" GPOs

## Common Troubleshooting Scenarios

### Missing Policies
If expected policies don't appear in the simulation results:

1. **Check Security Filtering**:
   - Verify the simulated user/computer has the necessary security group memberships
   - Look in the "Denied GPOs" section for security filtering issues

2. **Examine WMI Filters**:
   - Confirm if any WMI filters are preventing policy application
   - Test by disabling WMI filters in the simulation

3. **Verify Block Inheritance**:
   - Check if there's a Block Inheritance setting at the OU level
   - Examine if the policy needs to be set to "Enforced"

4. **Review Authentication Issues**:
   - Some security policies require specific authentication methods
   - Validate that authentication requirements are met

### Unexpected Settings
If simulation shows settings you didn't expect:

1. **Check GPO Precedence**:
   - Review the order of policy application
   - Look for higher-precedence policies overriding your expected settings

2. **Examine Inheritance**:
   - Check for inherited policies from parent OUs
   - Verify if any enforced policies are overriding local settings

3. **Review Loopback Processing**:
   - If loopback processing is enabled, check the computer-based user settings
   - Determine if the merge or replace mode is altering expected results

### Multiple Definitions for the Same Setting
When a setting is defined in multiple policies:

1. **Check the "Winning GPO" column** to identify which definition takes effect
2. **Review the GPO precedence order** to understand why one policy wins
3. **Look for "Enforced" settings** that override normal precedence rules
4. **Consider consolidating policies** to reduce conflicts

### Script and Software Deployment Issues
For scripts and software installation problems:

1. **Script Execution**:
   - Check if scripts are set to run with appropriate permissions
   - Verify script paths are accessible to the target user/computer

2. **Software Installation**:
   - Confirm the package is available at the specified path
   - Check for appropriate permission on the software installation share
   - Validate that the package type (assigned/published) is correctly set

## Best Practices

### Modeling Before Deployment
Always use the GPO Modeling Wizard before deploying significant policy changes:

1. Create a baseline simulation of the current environment
2. Simulate the proposed changes
3. Compare results to identify unexpected consequences
4. Adjust the policy design based on simulation results
5. Re-simulate until desired outcomes are achieved

### Documentation and Change Management
Maintain thorough documentation of your modeling results:

1. Save the modeling results for reference (right-click on the result and select "Save Report")
2. Document both the simulation parameters and outcomes
3. Include modeling results in change management documentation
4. Use modeling results as justification for policy design decisions

### Test Group Validation
Combine modeling with a staged deployment approach:

1. Model the policy changes for a test group
2. Apply the changes to a small pilot group
3. Verify that real-world results match the modeling predictions
4. Adjust policies as needed based on pilot feedback
5. Scale to full deployment with confidence

### Regular Revalidation
As your environment evolves, revalidate existing policies:

1. Schedule periodic modeling of critical policies
2. Rerun simulations after directory structure changes
3. Verify continued policy effectiveness after domain upgrades
4. Use modeling to catch unintended consequences of infrastructure changes

### Common GPO Modeling Scenarios to Test
Regularly model these common scenarios to maintain policy health:

1. New employee onboarding with different department placements
2. User role transitions across departments
3. Computer migrations between OUs
4. Impact of new organization-wide policies
5. Effects of security group changes on policy application

## PowerShell Integration

### Using Group Policy Cmdlets for Modeling
PowerShell provides a powerful command-line alternative to the graphical wizard:

```powershell
# Import the Group Policy module
Import-Module GroupPolicy

# Create a model simulation
$simulation = New-GPResultantSetOfPolicy -User "Domain\User" -Computer "Domain\Computer" -Planning

# Simulate with specific options
$simulation = New-GPResultantSetOfPolicy -UserName "jsmith" -UserSOM "OU=Marketing,DC=contoso,DC=com" `
                                       -ComputerName "DESKTOP-01" -ComputerSOM "OU=Finance,DC=contoso,DC=com" `
                                       -Planning -AsJob

# Get and display results
$results = Receive-Job $simulation -Wait
$results | Format-List *
```

### Extended PowerShell Modeling
For more complex modeling scenarios, you can use extended parameters:

```powershell
# Simulate with Loopback Processing
$simulation = New-GPResultantSetOfPolicy `
    -UserName "jsmith" `
    -UserSOM "OU=Marketing,DC=contoso,DC=com" `
    -ComputerName "DESKTOP-01" `
    -ComputerSOM "OU=Kiosks,DC=contoso,DC=com" `
    -LoopbackMode "Replace" `
    -Planning

# Simulate with specific security groups
$simulation = New-GPResultantSetOfPolicy `
    -UserName "jsmith" `
    -UserSOM "OU=Marketing,DC=contoso,DC=com" `
    -ComputerName "DESKTOP-01" `
    -ComputerSOM "OU=Finance,DC=contoso,DC=com" `
    -UserSecurityGroups "Domain Users", "Marketing Team", "Project Leads" `
    -Planning
```

### Building Advanced Modeling Reports
Use PowerShell to create comprehensive GPO modeling reports:

```powershell
# Define a function to create modeling reports
function New-GPOModelingReport {
    param (
        [string]$UserOU,
        [string]$ComputerOU,
        [string]$OutputFolder = "C:\Reports\GPO"
    )
    
    # Create output folder if it doesn't exist
    if (-not (Test-Path $OutputFolder)) {
        New-Item -Path $OutputFolder -ItemType Directory -Force
    }
    
    # Create a timestamp for the report
    $timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd-HHmmss"
    $outFile = Join-Path $OutputFolder "GPOModel-$timestamp.html"
    
    # Run the simulation
    $simulation = New-GPResultantSetOfPolicy -UserSOM $UserOU -ComputerSOM $ComputerOU -Planning
    
    # Generate and save the report
    Get-GPResultantSetOfPolicyReport -Xml $simulation -Path $outFile -ReportType Html
    
    # Return the report path
    return $outFile
}

# Example usage
$report = New-GPOModelingReport -UserOU "OU=Marketing,DC=contoso,DC=com" -ComputerOU "OU=Finance,DC=contoso,DC=com"
Invoke-Item $report
```

### Batch Modeling for Multiple Scenarios
Test multiple GPO configurations at once with batch processing:

```powershell
# Define a function for batch modeling
function Invoke-BatchGPOModeling {
    param (
        [array]$Scenarios,
        [string]$OutputFolder = "C:\Reports\GPO"
    )
    
    foreach ($scenario in $Scenarios) {
        $reportName = "GPOModel-$($scenario.Name)-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd').html"
        $outFile = Join-Path $OutputFolder $reportName
        
        Write-Host "Processing scenario: $($scenario.Name)" -ForegroundColor Green
        
        $simulation = New-GPResultantSetOfPolicy `
            -UserSOM $scenario.UserOU `
            -ComputerSOM $scenario.ComputerOU `
            -Planning
            
        Get-GPResultantSetOfPolicyReport -Xml $simulation -Path $outFile -ReportType Html
        Write-Host "Report saved to: $outFile" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    }
}

# Example usage
$scenarios = @(
    @{
        Name = "Marketing-FinancePC"
        UserOU = "OU=Marketing,DC=contoso,DC=com"
        ComputerOU = "OU=Finance,DC=contoso,DC=com"
    },
    @{
        Name = "HR-KioskPC"
        UserOU = "OU=HR,DC=contoso,DC=com"
        ComputerOU = "OU=Kiosks,DC=contoso,DC=com"
    },
    @{
        Name = "Exec-LaptopPC"
        UserOU = "OU=Executives,DC=contoso,DC=com"
        ComputerOU = "OU=Laptops,DC=contoso,DC=com"
    }
)

Invoke-BatchGPOModeling -Scenarios $scenarios
```
