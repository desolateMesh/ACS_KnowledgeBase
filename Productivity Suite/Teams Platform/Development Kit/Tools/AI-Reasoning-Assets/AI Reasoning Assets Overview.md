# AI Reasoning Assets Overview

## Introduction

AI Reasoning Assets are specialized components within the Microsoft Teams Development Kit that enhance AI agents' capabilities to process information, make decisions, and generate solutions with higher accuracy and reasoning capabilities. These assets serve as foundational building blocks that developers can integrate into their Teams applications to implement advanced analytical and decision-making capabilities.

## Purpose and Value

AI Reasoning Assets are designed to:

- Augment standard AI capabilities with structured reasoning frameworks
- Improve the quality and reliability of AI-generated responses and decisions
- Provide transparent, traceable decision paths for better explainability
- Enable more complex problem-solving in Teams applications
- Reduce hallucinations and inaccuracies in AI responses
- Support compliance with organizational policies and guidelines

## Core Components

### 1. Chain-of-Thought Frameworks

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) assets enable AI agents to break down complex problems into sequential reasoning steps, similar to human cognitive processes.

**Key Features:**
- Step-by-step reasoning templates
- Intermediate thought verbalization
- Verification checkpoints
- Error correction mechanisms
- Confidence scoring

**Implementation Example:**
```javascript
// Basic Chain-of-Thought implementation
const chainOfThought = new AIReasoningAsset.ChainOfThought({
  steps: [
    "Understand the problem statement",
    "Identify relevant information and constraints",
    "Generate possible approaches",
    "Evaluate each approach against constraints",
    "Select optimal approach",
    "Verify solution validity"
  ],
  requireExplanation: true,
  confidenceThreshold: 0.75
});

await agent.enhance(chainOfThought);
```

### 2. Tree-of-Thoughts Engine

The Tree-of-Thoughts asset extends Chain-of-Thought by exploring multiple reasoning paths simultaneously, evaluating different branches of logic before determining the optimal solution path.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-path exploration
- Branch evaluation and pruning
- Depth and breadth controls
- Search algorithm flexibility (BFS, DFS, beam search)
- Path recombination

**Implementation Example:**
```javascript
// Tree-of-Thoughts with beam search
const treeOfThoughts = new AIReasoningAsset.TreeOfThoughts({
  maxDepth: 5,
  beamWidth: 3,
  evaluationMetric: "relevance",
  explorationStrategy: "beam_search",
  earlyStoppingEnabled: true
});

await agent.enhance(treeOfThoughts);
```

### 3. Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning

This asset integrates knowledge retrieval with reasoning processes to ground AI decision-making in factual information.

**Key Features:**
- Context-aware knowledge retrieval
- Source credibility evaluation
- Information synthesis
- Citation management
- Fact verification

**Implementation Example:**
```javascript
// Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning setup
const retrievalReasoning = new AIReasoningAsset.RetrievalAugmentedReasoning({
  knowledgeSources: [teamKnowledgeBase, companyPolicies, industryStandards],
  retrievalStrategy: "hybrid",
  citationRequired: true,
  confidenceScoring: true,
  maxSourceCount: 5
});

await agent.enhance(retrievalReasoning);
```

### 4. Deliberate Reasoning

The Deliberate Reasoning asset implements more careful, methodical approaches to problem-solving, particularly useful for high-stakes decisions or complex scenarios.

**Key Features:**
- Multiple perspective consideration
- Counterfactual reasoning
- Bias detection and mitigation
- Uncertainty handling
- Pros/cons analysis

**Implementation Example:**
```javascript
// Deliberate Reasoning implementation
const deliberateReasoning = new AIReasoningAsset.DeliberateReasoning({
  perspectiveCount: 3,
  evaluationCriteria: ["feasibility", "impact", "cost", "risk"],
  counterargumentGeneration: true,
  uncertaintyThreshold: 0.2,
  reasoningDepth: "extensive"
});

await agent.enhance(deliberateReasoning);
```

### 5. Meta-Cognition Framework

This advanced asset enables AI systems to reason about their own reasoning processes, improving self-monitoring and quality control.

**Key Features:**
- Self-evaluation capabilities
- Reasoning strategy adjustment
- Knowledge gap identification
- Solution quality assessment
- Learning from past reasoning processes

**Implementation Example:**
```javascript
// Meta-Cognition Framework configuration
const metaCognition = new AIReasoningAsset.MetaCognition({
  selfEvaluationEnabled: true,
  strategyAdaptation: "dynamic",
  performanceMetrics: ["accuracy", "comprehensiveness", "consistency"],
  learningRate: 0.05,
  confidenceCalibration: true
});

await agent.enhance(metaCognition);
```

## Integration Guidelines

### Prerequisites

Before implementing AI Reasoning Assets in your Teams application:

1. Ensure you have the Teams Development Kit v4.2.0 or higher
2. Install the AI Reasoning Assets package:
   ```bash
   npm install @microsoft/teams-ai-reasoning-assets
   ```
3. Configure your AI service connections:
   ```javascript
   const reasoningConfig = {
     azureOpenAI: {
       endpoint: process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT,
       apiKey: process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY,
       deploymentName: process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT
     },
     modelCapabilities: {
       supportsCoT: true,
       supportsToT: true,
       maxTokens: 8192
     }
   };
   ```

### Implementation Workflow

1. **Asset Selection**: Choose appropriate reasoning assets based on your use case requirements
2. **Configuration**: Set up asset parameters to align with your application's specific needs
3. **Integration**: Add the assets to your AI agent's processing pipeline
4. **Testing**: Validate reasoning quality across various scenarios
5. **Monitoring**: Implement tracking mechanisms to evaluate reasoning performance
6. **Refinement**: Iterate on asset configurations to improve outcomes

### Combining Assets

Assets can be combined to create more sophisticated reasoning capabilities:

```javascript
// Combining multiple reasoning assets
const enhancedAgent = new TeamsAIAgent();

// Add Chain-of-Thought for basic reasoning
await enhancedAgent.enhance(chainOfThought);

// Layer on retrieval capabilities
await enhancedAgent.enhance(retrievalReasoning);

// Add metacognitive monitoring
await enhancedAgent.enhance(metaCognition);

// Set asset priority and conflicts resolution
enhancedAgent.setAssetPriorities({
  conflictResolution: "prioritized",
  order: ["retrievalReasoning", "chainOfThought", "metaCognition"]
});
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

- **Caching**: Implement reasoning path caching for similar queries
- **Pruning**: Configure early stopping for inefficient reasoning branches
