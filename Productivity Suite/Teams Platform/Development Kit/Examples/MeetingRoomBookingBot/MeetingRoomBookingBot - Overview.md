- Conversational bot interface for natural language requests
- Visual confirmation of successful bookings

## Technical Architecture

The MeetingRoomBookingBot consists of several key components:

1. **Teams Bot Framework Integration**: Core bot functionality
2. **Azure Bot Service**: Hosting and message handling
3. **Microsoft Graph API Client**: Room resource access and calendar management
4. **Adaptive Cards Renderer**: Dynamic UI generation
5. **Teams Messaging Extension**: Quick access point
6. **Azure App Service**: Application hosting

For a detailed technical breakdown, refer to [MeetingRoomBookingBot-Architecture-diagram.md](./MeetingRoomBookingBot-Architecture-diagram.md).

## Data Flow

1. User initiates booking request via Teams
2. Bot queries Microsoft Graph for available rooms
3. Results displayed to user via Adaptive Cards
4. User selects room and booking details
5. Bot creates calendar event via Graph API
6. Confirmation returned to user

## Implementation Prerequisites

### Technical Requirements

- Microsoft 365 tenant with Teams
- Azure subscription
- Room resources properly configured in Exchange
- Application registration in Azure AD with appropriate permissions
- Development environment with .NET Core 6.0+

### Permissions & Security

The bot requires these Microsoft Graph permissions:
- `Calendars.ReadWrite`
- `Place.Read.All`
- `User.Read`
- `User.ReadBasic.All`

For detailed deployment steps, see [MeetingRoomBookingBot-Deployment-Guide.md](./MeetingRoomBookingBot-Deployment-Guide.md).

## Integration Points

### Microsoft Graph API

The bot uses Graph API to:
- Query room resources
- Check availability
- Create/update calendar events
- Manage bookings

For implementation details, see [MeetingRoomBookingBot-Graph-Api-Room-Resources.md](./MeetingRoomBookingBot-Graph-Api-Room-Resources.md).

### Teams Platform

The solution integrates with Teams via:
- Bot Framework registration
- Messaging Extensions
- Adaptive Cards
- Teams App packaging

For setup instructions, refer to [MeetingRoomBookingBot-Teams-Messaging-Extension-Setup.md](./MeetingRoomBookingBot-Teams-Messaging-Extension-Setup.md).

## User Experience Flow

1. **Initiation**: User accesses bot through:
   - Direct message to bot
   - Messaging extension
   - Group chat invocation

2. **Room Selection**:
   - User specifies requirements (time, capacity, location)
   - Bot presents matching available rooms
   - User selects preferred room

3. **Booking Details**:
   - User completes booking form
   - Adds meeting title, time, participants

4. **Confirmation**:
   - Bot creates calendar event
   - Sends confirmation with meeting details
   - Provides options to modify or cancel

For the complete user flow with Adaptive Cards, see [MeetingRoomBookingBot-Adaptive-Card-Booking-Flow.md](./MeetingRoomBookingBot-Adaptive-Card-Booking-Flow.md).

## Key Code Components

### Bot Framework Registration

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_1);
    
    // Create the Bot Framework Adapter
    services.AddSingleton<IBotFrameworkHttpAdapter, AdapterWithErrorHandler>();
    
    // Create the bot as a transient
    services.AddTransient<IBot, MeetingRoomBot>();
    
    // Add Microsoft Graph support
    services.AddSingleton<IGraphClientService, GraphClientService>();
    
    // Add room booking service
    services.AddTransient<IRoomBookingService, RoomBookingService>();
}
```

### Graph API Room Query

```csharp
public async Task<List<Room>> GetAvailableRoomsAsync(DateTime startTime, DateTime endTime, int capacity = 0)
{
    var graphClient = await _graphClientFactory.GetAuthenticatedClientAsync();
    
    // Query all rooms
    var places = await graphClient.Places
        .Request()
        .Filter("resourceType eq 'room'")
        .GetAsync();
    
    // Filter by capacity if specified
    var rooms = places.CurrentPage
        .Where(p => capacity == 0 || p.Capacity >= capacity)
        .ToList();
    
    // Check availability for each room
    var availableRooms = new List<Room>();
    foreach (var room in rooms)
    {
        var scheduleItems = await GetRoomScheduleAsync(graphClient, room.EmailAddress, startTime, endTime);
        if (!scheduleItems.Any(s => s.Status == "Busy"))
        {
            availableRooms.Add(new Room
            {
                Id = room.Id,
                DisplayName = room.DisplayName,
                EmailAddress = room.EmailAddress,
                Building = room.Building,
                Capacity = room.Capacity,
                Floor = room.FloorLabel
            });
        }
    }
    
    return availableRooms;
}
```

### Adaptive Card Generation

```csharp
private Attachment CreateRoomSelectionCard(List<Room> rooms)
{
    var card = new AdaptiveCard(new AdaptiveSchemaVersion(1, 3));
    
    // Add card header
    card.Body.Add(new AdaptiveTextBlock
    {
        Text = "Available Meeting Rooms",
        Size = AdaptiveTextSize.Large,
        Weight = AdaptiveTextWeight.Bolder
    });
    
    // Create room selection options
    var roomChoices = new List<AdaptiveChoice>();
    foreach (var room in rooms)
    {
        roomChoices.Add(new AdaptiveChoice
        {
            Title = $"{room.DisplayName} (Capacity: {room.Capacity})",
            Value = room.Id
        });
    }
    
    // Add room selection input
    card.Body.Add(new AdaptiveChoiceSetInput
    {
        Id = "roomSelection",
        Style = AdaptiveChoiceInputStyle.Expanded,
        Choices = roomChoices
    });
    
    // Add booking button
    card.Actions.Add(new AdaptiveSubmitAction
    {
        Title = "Book Selected Room",
        Data = new { action = "bookRoom" }
    });
    
    return new Attachment
    {
        ContentType = AdaptiveCard.ContentType,
        Content = card
    };
}
```

## Extensibility Options

The MeetingRoomBookingBot can be extended in several ways:

1. **Custom Room Attributes**: Add organization-specific room properties
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Implement specialized search capabilities
3. **Booking Policies**: Enforce organization-specific reservation rules
4. **Reporting**: Add analytics on room usage and booking patterns

## Troubleshooting

For common issues and their resolutions, refer to [MeetingRoomBookingBot-Troubleshooting.md](./MeetingRoomBookingBot-Troubleshooting.md).

## Best Practices

1. **Room Configuration**: Ensure Exchange room resources are properly configured
2. **Permission Management**: Use least-privilege access for bot application
3. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling for Graph API calls
4. **User Communication**: Provide clear feedback for success/failure states
5. **Throttling Management**: Implement retry strategies for API rate limiting
6. **Logging**: Enable appropriate logging for debugging and auditing
