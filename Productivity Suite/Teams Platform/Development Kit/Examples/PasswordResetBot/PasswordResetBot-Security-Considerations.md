# Password Reset Bot - Security Considerations

## Overview

The Password Reset Bot is designed to automate the password reset process for users within an organization. While this automation increases efficiency and reduces the workload on IT support staff, it also introduces unique security challenges. This document outlines comprehensive security considerations that should be addressed when implementing a Password Reset Bot in Teams using the Development Kit.

## Critical Security Principles

### 1. Zero Trust Architecture

- **Assume breach**: Design the system assuming attackers may already have access to your network
- **Verify explicitly**: Authenticate and authorize based on all available data points
- **Least privilege access**: Limit access rights to only what is necessary for each operation
- **Defense in depth**: Layer security controls to protect against various attack vectors

### 2. Information Classification

The Password Reset Bot handles sensitive authentication data including:

- User identities
- Authentication credentials
- Security questions/answers
- Password reset tokens
- Audit trails and logs

This information should be classified as highly sensitive and protected accordingly.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Requirements

- **Enforce MFA**: Require multi-factor authentication before proceeding with password reset operations
- **Risk-based authentication**: Apply more stringent authentication requirements for sensitive accounts
- **Channel verification**: Verify the identity of the user through another communication channel (email, SMS, authenticator app)

### Identity Verification Methods

- **Knowledge-based authentication**: Security questions should be sufficiently complex and unique
- **Possession-based verification**: Utilize tokens sent to registered devices or email addresses
- **Biometric verification**: Where possible, leverage biometric verification through registered devices
- **Manager approval flow**: For high-privilege accounts, implement approval workflows requiring manager confirmation

### Authorization Scopes

| Scope | Description | Required For |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| User.Read | Read basic user profile | Basic user identification |
| User.ReadWrite | Update user profile information | Password updates |
| Directory.AccessAsUser.All | Access directory as the signed-in user | Directory operations |
| IdentityRiskyUser.Read.All | Read identity risk information | Risk-based authentication |

## Secure Data Handling

### Data in Transit

- **TLS 1.3**: Enforce TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Certificate validation**: Implement proper certificate validation to prevent MITM attacks
- **Secure webhook endpoints**: Ensure all webhook endpoints use HTTPS and validate incoming requests

### Data at Rest

- **Encryption**: Use strong encryption (AES-256) for all stored sensitive data
- **Key management**: Implement proper key rotation and management
- **Secure storage**: Utilize Azure Key Vault for storing secrets and credentials

### Data Minimization

- **Collect minimum required information**: Only collect data necessary for the password reset process
- **Limited retention**: Define and enforce data retention policies for all collected data
- **Secure disposal**: Implement secure data disposal methods when data is no longer needed

## Secure Development Practices

### Code Security

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Implement automated security testing in the CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependency scanning**: Regularly scan and update dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- **Secret detection**: Use automated tools to detect hardcoded secrets in the codebase
- **Code reviews**: Conduct security-focused code reviews for all changes

### Secure Bot Implementation

- **Bot Framework security**: Follow the [Microsoft Bot Framework security best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-security)
- **Application permissions**: Use delegated permissions when possible, over application permissions
- **Connection security**: Ensure all bot connections use secure protocols and authentication

### API Security

- **API authentication**: Implement OAuth 2.0 with proper scope validation
- **Rate limiting**: Apply rate limiting to prevent abuse and brute force attacks
- **Input validation**: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- **Output encoding**: Properly encode all outputs to prevent XSS attacks

## Threat Modeling and Risk Mitigation

### Common Attack Vectors

| Attack Vector | Description | Mitigation |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Phishing | Fake password reset requests | Identity verification, user education |
| Brute Force | Repeated password reset attempts | Rate limiting, account lockout, CAPTCHA |
| Session Hijacking | Stealing authentication sessions | Short-lived tokens, secure cookie attributes |
| Man-in-the-Middle | Intercepting communications | Certificate pinning, TLS enforcement |
| Social Engineering | Manipulating users or admins | User education, strict verification processes |

### Risk-Based Controls

Implement adaptive controls based on risk factors:

- **User's location**: Apply additional verification for unusual locations
- **Device trust**: Verify device trust level before proceeding
- **Access patterns**: Flag unusual access patterns for additional verification
- **Account sensitivity**: Apply stricter controls for privileged accounts

## Monitoring and Incident Response

### Security Monitoring

- **Audit logging**: Maintain detailed logs of all password reset activities
- **Anomaly detection**: Implement detection mechanisms for unusual patterns
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Integrate with SIEM solutions for centralized monitoring
- **Alert thresholds**: Define and implement appropriate alert thresholds for suspicious activities

### Incident Response Plan

Document and implement a specific incident response plan for the Password Reset Bot:

1. **Detection**: Identify potential security incidents through monitoring
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems and accounts
3. **Eradication**: Remove threats and vulnerabilities
4. **Recovery**: Restore affected systems and accounts securely
5. **Lessons learned**: Review and improve security controls

## Compliance Requirements

### Regulatory Considerations

- **GDPR**: Ensure compliance with data protection requirements
- **HIPAA**: For healthcare organizations, ensure compliance with HIPAA requirements
- **SOX**: For publicly traded companies, ensure compliance with SOX requirements
- **PCI DSS**: If handling payment card data, ensure compliance with PCI DSS

### Microsoft Cloud App Security

Integrate with Microsoft Cloud App Security for enhanced protection:

- **Anomaly detection policies**: Detect unusual patterns in user behavior
- **Activity monitoring**: Monitor all bot activities for suspicious patterns
- **Session controls**: Implement real-time session monitoring and control

## Implementation Guidelines

### Azure Key Vault Integration

```csharp
// Example: Retrieving secrets from Azure Key Vault
var secretClient = new SecretClient(new Uri(keyVaultUrl), new DefaultAzureCredential());
KeyVaultSecret secret = await secretClient.GetSecretAsync("PasswordResetApiKey");
string apiKey = secret.Value;
```

### Implementing Secure Token Handling

```csharp
// Example: Generating a secure reset token
using var rng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();
var tokenData = new byte[32]; // 256 bits
rng.GetBytes(tokenData);
string resetToken = Convert.ToBase64String(tokenData);

// Store token with expiration
await StoreResetTokenAsync(userId, resetToken, DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(15));
```

### Secure Password Policy Enforcement

```csharp
// Example: Validating password against policy
public bool ValidatePasswordComplexity(string password)
{
    // Minimum length
    if (password.Length < 12) return false;
    
    // Character types
    bool hasUpper = password.Any(char.IsUpper);
    bool hasLower = password.Any(char.IsLower);
    bool hasDigit = password.Any(char.IsDigit);
    bool hasSpecial = password.Any(c => !char.IsLetterOrDigit(c));
    
    // Check all requirements are met
    return hasUpper && hasLower && hasDigit && hasSpecial;
}
```
