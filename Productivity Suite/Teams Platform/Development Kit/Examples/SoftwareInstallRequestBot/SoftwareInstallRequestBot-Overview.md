The Software Install Request Bot leverages several key technologies:

1. **Microsoft Teams Platform**: Hosts the bot interface and provides the user interaction layer
2. **Azure Bot Service**: Manages bot conversations and dialog flows
3. **Adaptive Cards**: Provides rich, interactive UI components for form submission and status updates
4. **Azure Functions**: Handles backend logic, data processing, and third-party integrations
5. **Azure Storage**: Maintains state and stores request information
6. **Azure Active Directory**: Manages authentication and authorization
7. **ITSM Connectors**: Integrates with systems like ServiceNow, Jira Service Desk, or Microsoft SCSM

### Data Flow

1. User initiates a software installation request via Teams
2. Bot presents an adaptive card form capturing software details, business justification, etc.
3. Completed request is processed by Azure Function, which:
   - Validates request data
   - Identifies appropriate approvers based on organizational policies
   - Creates a record in the connected ITSM system
   - Stores request state in Azure Storage
4. Notifications are sent to approvers via Teams
5. Approvers review and act on the request, also via Teams
6. Upon approval, IT fulfillment teams are notified
7. Status updates flow back to the requestor through Teams notifications

## Functional Capabilities

### User Interaction Flow

1. **Request Initiation**:
   - Users can initiate requests through direct chat with the bot
   - Teams commands like `/request-software` can launch the process
   - Departmental Teams channels can host the bot for team-specific requests

2. **Information Capture**:
   - Software name and version
   - Business justification
   - Urgency level
   - Additional specifications (e.g., specific features needed)
   - Cost center information (optional)
   - Attachments (e.g., vendor documentation)

3. **Request Tracking**:
   - Unique request ID generation
   - Real-time status updates
   - Estimated fulfillment timeline
   - History view of all requests

4. **Approval Workflow**:
   - Multi-level approval capabilities
   - Customizable approval thresholds based on software cost/category
   - Delegate approver functionality
   - Approval reminders and escalation paths

5. **Admin Functions**:
   - Request dashboard and reporting
   - Workflow configuration
   - Integration settings management
   - Access control and permissions

### Integration Capabilities

The bot can integrate with:

- **IT Service Management Systems**: ServiceNow, Jira Service Desk, Microsoft SCSM, Freshservice
- **Software Asset Management Tools**: Flexera, Snow Software, Microsoft Endpoint Manager
- **Procurement Systems**: SAP Ariba, Coupa

[Command("request-software")]
public async Task HandleSoftwareRequestCommand(ITurnContext turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    var dialogOptions = new SoftwareRequestDialogOptions
    {
        InitiatedBy = turnContext.Activity.From.Id,
        RequestDate = DateTime.UtcNow,
        OrganizationUnit = await _userProfileService.GetUserDepartment(turnContext.Activity.From.Id)
    };
    
    await _dialogContext.BeginDialogAsync(nameof(SoftwareRequestDialog), dialogOptions, cancellationToken);
}
```

**Creating an Approval Adaptive Card**:

```csharp
private AdaptiveCard CreateApprovalCard(SoftwareRequest request)
{
    return new AdaptiveCard(new AdaptiveSchemaVersion(1, 3))
    {
        Body = new List<AdaptiveElement>
        {
            new AdaptiveTextBlock
            {
                Text = $"Software Request #{request.RequestId}",
                Size = AdaptiveTextSize.Large,
                Weight = AdaptiveTextWeight.Bolder
            },
            new AdaptiveFactSet
            {
                Facts = new List<AdaptiveFact>
                {
                    new AdaptiveFact("Requested by:", request.RequesterName),
                    new AdaptiveFact("Software:", request.SoftwareName),
                    new AdaptiveFact("Version:", request.SoftwareVersion),
                    new AdaptiveFact("Business Justification:", request.BusinessJustification)
                }
            }
        },
        Actions = new List<AdaptiveAction>
        {
            new AdaptiveSubmitAction
            {
                Title = "Approve",
                Data = new ApprovalActionData
                {
                    RequestId = request.RequestId,
                    Action = ApprovalAction.Approve
                }
            },
            new AdaptiveSubmitAction
            {
                Title = "Reject",
                Data = new ApprovalActionData
                {
                    RequestId = request.RequestId,
                    Action = ApprovalAction.Reject
                }
            }
        }
    };
}
```

**ITSM Integration Example (ServiceNow)**:

```csharp
public async Task<string> CreateServiceNowTicket(SoftwareRequest request)
{
    var serviceNowClient = _httpClientFactory.CreateClient("ServiceNowClient");
    
    var ticketData = new
    {
        short_description = $"Software Installation Request: {request.SoftwareName}",
        description = $"Request Details:\nRequester: {request.RequesterName}\nSoftware: {request.SoftwareName} {request.SoftwareVersion}\nJustification: {request.BusinessJustification}",
        urgency = MapUrgencyLevel(request.UrgencyLevel),
        assignment_group = _configuration["ServiceNow:SoftwareAssignmentGroup"],
        caller_id = await GetServiceNowUserId(request.RequesterId)
    };
    
    var response = await serviceNowClient.PostAsJsonAsync("api/now/table/incident", ticketData);
    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
    
    var responseBody = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<ServiceNowResponse>();
    return responseBody.result.sys_id;
}
```
