## Architecture

The User Completion Tracking component employs a layered architecture:

1. **Data Layer**: 
   - Azure SQL Database or Cosmos DB for storing user completion records
   - Azure Table Storage for tracking historical completion data
   - Azure Blob Storage for storing completion certificates and evidence

2. **Service Layer**:
   - RESTful API services that handle CRUD operations for completion records
   - Background Azure Functions for periodic synchronization with external LMS systems
   - Event processing with Azure Event Grid for real-time completion events

3. **Integration Layer**:
   - Connectors to popular LMS platforms (e.g., Microsoft Learn, Cornerstone, Workday Learning)
   - Custom webhook receivers for third-party training systems
   - Microsoft Graph API integration for user profile synchronization

4. **Presentation Layer**:
   - Teams Adaptive Cards for displaying user progress
   - Power BI embedded reports for management dashboards
   - Export services for compliance audit reporting

## Data Structure

The core user completion data model includes:

```json
{
  "userId": "string",          // Unique Microsoft Teams/AAD user identifier
  "displayName": "string",     // User's display name
  "email": "string",           // User's email address
  "departmentId": "string",    // User's department identifier
  "trainingModules": [
    {
      "moduleId": "string",    // Unique training module identifier
      "moduleName": "string",  // Human-readable module name
      "assignedDate": "date",  // When the module was assigned
      "dueDate": "date",       // When the module must be completed by
      "completionStatus": "string", // See Completion Status Types section
      "completionDate": "date", // When the module was completed (if applicable)
      "completionScore": "number", // Score achieved (if applicable)
      "passingScore": "number", // Minimum required score
      "attempts": "number",    // Number of attempts made
      "certificateUrl": "string", // URL to completion certificate
      "validUntil": "date",    // Date when recertification is required
      "metadata": {            // Additional module-specific information
        "key": "value"
      }
    }
  ],
  "overallComplianceStatus": "string", // Aggregate compliance status
  "lastSyncDate": "date"      // When data was last synchronized from LMS
}
```

## Integration Methods

The bot offers multiple methods for tracking user completion:

### 1. Direct API Integration

For LMS systems with available APIs, the bot establishes direct integration using:

```csharp
// Example code for LMS API integration
public async Task<List<CompletionRecord>> SyncCompletionRecordsAsync(string lmsProvider, DateTime syncFrom)
{
    var integrationProvider = _integrationFactory.GetProvider(lmsProvider);
    var newRecords = await integrationProvider.FetchCompletionRecordsAsync(syncFrom);
    await _dataService.UpdateCompletionRecordsAsync(newRecords);
    return newRecords;
}
```

### 2. Webhook Receivers

For real-time completion notifications:

```csharp
// Example webhook endpoint for completion events
[HttpPost]
[Route("api/completion-webhook")]
public async Task<IActionResult> ReceiveCompletionWebhook([FromBody] CompletionWebhookPayload payload)
{
    if (!_authService.ValidateWebhookSignature(payload, Request.Headers))
    {
        return Unauthorized();
    }
    
    await _trackingService.ProcessCompletionEventAsync(payload);
    return Ok();
}
```

### 3. CSV Import

For systems without API access, the bot supports scheduled CSV imports:

```csharp
// Example CSV processing logic
public async Task ProcessCompletionCsvAsync(Stream csvStream)
{
    using var reader = new StreamReader(csvStream);
    using var csv = new CsvReader(reader, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
    
    var records = csv.GetRecords<CompletionCsvRecord>();
    await _trackingService.BulkUpdateCompletionAsync(records);
}
```

### 4. User Self-Reporting

For certain training types, users can self-report completion with verification:

```csharp
// Example self-reporting with manager approval
public async Task SubmitCompletionProofAsync(string userId, string moduleId, Stream certificateFile)
{
    var blobUrl = await _storageService.UploadCertificateAsync(userId, moduleId, certificateFile);
    await _approvalService.InitiateApprovalWorkflowAsync(userId, moduleId, blobUrl);
}
```

## Completion Status Types

The system recognizes the following completion status types:

| Status | Description | Action Required |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `NotStarted` | User has not begun the training | Initial reminder sent |
| `InProgress` | User has started but not completed | Progress check reminders |
| `Completed` | User has successfully completed | Certificate generation |
| `Failed` | User attempted but did not pass | Retry reminder |
| `Expired` | Certification has expired | Recertification reminder |
| `Exempted` | User is exempt from this requirement | Documented reason required |
| `PendingApproval` | Completion awaiting verification | Management approval needed |
| `NonCompliant` | Past due without completion | Escalation workflow triggered |

## Tracking Logic

### Assignment Rules

Assignment of training modules follows these principles:

1. **Role-Based Assignment**: Modules assigned based on job function
2. **Location-Based Requirements**: Region-specific compliance requirements
3. **Seniority Rules**: Additional requirements for managers/team leads
4. **Certification Cycles**: Recurring training with predetermined intervals

### Completion Verification

The bot employs multiple verification methods:

1. **Score Verification**: Ensures passing score thresholds are met
2. **Timing Analysis**: Validates reasonable completion time (prevents rushing)
3. **IP Verification**: Optional verification that training was completed from corporate network
4. **Manager Attestation**: For certain high-importance training

Example verification logic:

```csharp
public bool VerifyCompletion(CompletionRecord record)
{
    // Basic validation
    if (record.CompletionScore < record.PassingScore)
        return false;
        
    // Time spent validation
    TimeSpan timeSpent = record.CompletionDate - record.StartDate;
    if (timeSpent < _moduleConfig.MinimumRequiredTime)
        return false;
        
    // Additional validation logic
    // ...
    
    return true;
}
```

## Progress Reporting

### Individual User Reports

Individual users can view their compliance status through:

1. **Personal Dashboard**: Teams tab with visual indicators of progress
2. **Progress Cards**: Adaptive cards showing completion status
3. **Certificate Wallet**: Access to earned certificates
4. **Calendar Integration**: Due dates added to personal calendar

Example of user progress adaptive card:

```json
{
  "type": "AdaptiveCard",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "TextBlock",
      "size": "Medium",
      "weight": "Bolder",

            {
              "type": "TextBlock",
              "text": "{{moduleName}}",
              "wrap": true
            }
          ],
          "width": "stretch"
        },
        {
          "type": "Column",
          "items": [
            {

      "data": {
        "action": "viewDetails"
      }
    }
  ],
  "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
  "version": "1.5"
}
```

### Management Reports

For compliance officers and management:

1. **Compliance Dashboard**: Power BI-based dashboard showing organizational completion rates
2. **Department Reports**: Filterable by department, role, or training type
3. **Risk Analysis**: Highlighting departments with low completion rates
4. **Trend Reports**: Completion rate changes over time

### Automated Reporting

The system generates scheduled reports including:

1. **Daily Digest**: Summary of completion activity
2. **Non-compliance Report**: Users past due for training
3. **Executive Summary**: High-level compliance status for leadership
4. **Audit-Ready Reports**: Detailed records for regulatory audits

## Data Retention Policies

The user completion tracking system implements the following data retention policies:

1. **Active Records**: Maintained for the duration of employment plus one year
2. **Completion Evidence**: Certificates and proof maintained per regulatory requirements (typically 3-7 years)
3. **Archived Data**: After retention period, data is anonymized and aggregated for trend analysis
4. **Deletion Workflows**: Compliant with GDPR and other privacy regulations

Configuration example:

```json
{
  "retentionPolicies": {
    "activeEmployeeRecords": {
      "duration": "employment_plus_1_year",
      "archiveLocation": "azure_storage_archive"
    },
    "formerEmployeeRecords": {
      "duration": "7_years",
      "archiveLocation": "azure_storage_archive"
    },
    "completionEvidence": {
      "duration": "regulatory_requirement_or_7_years",
      "archiveLocation": "azure_storage_archive"
    },
    "auditLogs": {
      "duration": "7_years",
      "archiveLocation": "azure_storage_archive"
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

The user completion tracking system implements extensive security measures:

1. **Data Encryption**: All completion data encrypted at rest and in transit
2. **Access Control**: Role-based access control for viewing completion records
3. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logs of all data access and modifications
4. **Privacy Controls**: Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations
5. **Secure API Access**: Azure AD authentication for all API endpoints

Example security policy:

```csharp
[Authorize(Roles = "ComplianceAdmin,DepartmentManager")]
[AuditLog(EventType = "CompletionRecordAccess")]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetDepartmentCompletionReport(string departmentId)
{
    // Ensure user has access to requested department
    if (!await _authorizationService.CanAccessDepartmentAsync(User, departmentId))
    {
        return Forbid();
    }
    
    var report = await _reportingService.GenerateDepartmentReportAsync(departmentId);
    return Ok(report);
}
```
