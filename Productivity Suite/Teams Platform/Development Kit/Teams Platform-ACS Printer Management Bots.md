# ACS Printer Management Bots

## Overview

ACS Printer Management Bots are intelligent AI-powered assistants built on the Microsoft Teams platform that automate and streamline printer management tasks across the enterprise. These bots leverage the Azure Communication Services (ACS) infrastructure to provide seamless integration with Microsoft Teams while offering comprehensive printer management capabilities without requiring users to leave their collaboration environment.

- Automatic detection of printer errors and jams
- Dashboard for fleet-wide visibility of printer status

### Self-Service Capabilities
- Printer queue management through natural language commands
- Remote job cancellation and prioritization
- Document re-routing to alternative printers during outages
- Scheduled printing with customizable parameters

### Administrative Functions
- Centralized deployment of printer drivers and firmware updates
- Usage analytics and reporting by department/user/device
- Cost allocation and charge-back automation
- Policy enforcement for color printing, duplex defaults, etc.

### Troubleshooting Assistance
