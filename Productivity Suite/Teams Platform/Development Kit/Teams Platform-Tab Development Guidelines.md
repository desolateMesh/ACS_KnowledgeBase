## Tab Types and Capabilities

### Channel and Group Tabs

Channel and group tabs deliver content to channels and group chats, and are a great way to create collaborative spaces around dedicated web content.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Shared experience for all members of a team or group chat
- Support rich interactive experiences
- Can be configured when added to a channel or group chat
- Support context-sensitive functionality based on team/channel settings

**Use Cases:**
- Shared dashboards and reports
- Planning and project management tools

### Personal Tabs

Personal tabs are part of a personal app experience and are scoped to a single user. They can be pinned to the left navigation bar for easy access.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Private to the individual user
- Consistent experience across teams, group chats, and personal context
- Do not need configuration experiences
- Support rich interactive experiences

**Use Cases:**
- Individual dashboards
- Personal task tracking
- User preferences and settings
- Individual productivity tools
- Private data visualization

### Static and Configurable Tabs

**Static Tabs:**
- Pre-configured content
- No additional user input required
- Fixed functionality
- Used primarily for personal apps

**Configurable Tabs:**
- Require configuration when added to a channel or group chat
- Can be customized based on team/channel needs
- Support more flexible and context-specific functionality
- Include configuration page to gather settings

## Design Principles and Best Practices

### User-Centric Design

- Focus on solving specific team collaboration problems
- Reduce cognitive load by focusing on core functionality
- Design for the Teams collaborative context
- Create coherent navigation and interaction patterns
- Respect existing Teams workflows and interaction models
- Consider the shared vs. private content needs

### Teams Integration

- Design tabs to feel native to the Teams environment
- Implement appropriate loading states and error handling
- Support seamless authentication flows
- Utilize Teams theme capabilities
- Leverage Teams context information
- Support both desktop and mobile experiences

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize for initial load time (under 2 seconds target)
- Implement progressive loading for complex interfaces
- Minimize network requests
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Consider offline or degraded functionality support
- Optimize for Teams resource constraints

### Collaboration-First Approach

- Design interfaces that support multiple concurrent users
- Implement real-time updates where appropriate
- Consider how information sharing occurs within teams
- Provide mechanisms to call attention to important content
- Support @mentions and notifications where applicable
- Design for conversation-context relevance

## Development Prerequisites

### Required Tools and Technologies

- **Development Environment**:
  - Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or similar IDE
  - Node.js (LTS version recommended)
  - npm or yarn package manager
  - Git for version control

- **Microsoft 365 Development Account**:

- Single-page application development
- RESTful API design principles
- OAuth 2.0 authentication flows
- Microsoft Graph API basics
- Azure Active Directory concepts
- Teams platform fundamentals

## Technical Architecture

### Tab Application Structure

A typical Teams tab application consists of:

1. **Content Pages**: The primary web content displayed in the tab
2. **Configuration Page**: For configurable tabs, the page that collects settings
3. **Removal Page** (optional): Displayed when a tab is removed
4. **Manifest File**: Defines the application and its capabilities
5. **Backend Services** (optional): APIs and services to support tab functionality

### Content Hosting Options

Teams tabs can be hosted in various environments:

- **Azure Web Apps**: Microsoft's managed hosting platform
- **SharePoint**: For SharePoint-integrated tabs
- **Third-party Cloud Services**: AWS, Google Cloud, etc.
- **On-premises Infrastructure**: For organizations with specific hosting requirements

### Security Architecture

Consider the following security aspects:

- **Authentication**: Integration with AAD, MSAL libraries
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for tab content
- **Data Storage**: Secure storage of user and organizational data
- **Transmission Security**: TLS implementation, secure API calls
- **Content Security Policy**: Protection against XSS and injection attacks

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Flows

Teams tabs support multiple authentication methods:

1. **Silent Authentication**:
   - Seamless background authentication
   - Uses existing Teams context
   - No explicit user action required
   - Best user experience when applicable

2. **Tab-Aware Authentication**:
   - Uses Teams authentication APIs
   - Provides in-app login experience
   - Avoids pop-up blockers
   - Recommended for most scenarios

3. **Web-Based Authentication**:
   - Traditional OAuth/OIDC flows
   - May require pop-up windows
   - Fallback for complex authentication scenarios

### Authorization Patterns

- **User-based Authorization**:
  - Permissions tied to the individual user identity
  - Uses Azure AD roles or application-specific roles
  - Appropriate for personal tabs and user-specific actions

- **Team-based Authorization**:
  - Permissions based on team/channel membership
  - May leverage Teams owner vs. member distinctions
  - Suitable for shared content in channel tabs

- **Consent Management**:
  - Admin consent for organization-wide permissions
  - User consent for personal permissions
  - Incremental consent approaches for better user experience

### Microsoft Identity Platform Integration

- Azure Active Directory integration options
- Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) implementation
- Microsoft Graph API authorization
- Single sign-on (SSO) configuration
- Cross-domain authentication considerations

## SDK Integration

### Teams JavaScript Client SDK

The Teams JavaScript client SDK provides essential functionality for tabs:

```javascript
// Initialize the Teams SDK
microsoftTeams.initialize();

// Get the current context
microsoftTeams.getContext((context) => {
  // Use the context object to access Teams-specific information
  const teamId = context.teamId;
  const channelId = context.channelId;
  const userObjectId = context.userObjectId;
  const locale = context.locale;
});

// Handle theme changes
microsoftTeams.registerOnThemeChangeHandler((theme) => {
  // Update UI based on the theme
  document.body.className = theme;
});

// Notify Teams that the tab is loaded
microsoftTeams.authentication.notifySuccess();
```

### Key SDK Functions
