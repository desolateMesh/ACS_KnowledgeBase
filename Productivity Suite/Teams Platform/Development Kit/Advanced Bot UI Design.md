## Core Design Principles

### Conversation-First Approach

- **Natural Dialog Flow**: Design conversations that feel natural, with appropriate turn-taking and context awareness
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Introduce complexity gradually, showing only what's needed at each step
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain conversation history and context to avoid repetitive user input
- **Error Recovery**: Gracefully handle misunderstandings with clear recovery paths

### Bot Personality Design

- **Consistent Tone**: Establish and maintain a consistent voice appropriate for your use case
- **Personality Framework**: Define personality attributes (friendly/formal, verbose/concise)
- **Response Variability**: Include slight variations in common responses to avoid robotic repetition
- **Emotion Recognition**: Consider incorporating sentiment analysis to adapt tone based on user emotions

### Visual Hierarchy and Information Architecture

- **Clear Information Hierarchy**: Prioritize content using visual weight, color, and position
- **Chunking Information**: Break complex information into digestible blocks
- **Scannable Content**: Design for quick comprehension with headings, bullets, and concise text
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple and expand details as needed through user interaction

## Adaptive Cards Design Patterns

### Component Selection Guide

| Component | Best Use Cases | Limitations | Accessibility Considerations |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| TextBlock | Simple text display, headers | Limited formatting | Use heading levels appropriately |
| Input.Text | Short text input | Not ideal for long text | Include clear labels |
| Input.ChoiceSet | Selection from options | Renders differently across clients | Ensure sufficient color contrast |
| ActionSet | Grouped actions | Limited to button actions | Provide keyboard navigation |

## Responsive Design for Different Teams Clients

### Client-Specific Considerations

| Client | Screen Size | Special Considerations | Features to Avoid |
|--------|------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Desktop | Variable, typically large | Full feature support | Heavy animations |
| Web | Variable | Most features supported | Client-specific APIs |
| Mobile (iOS) | Small, portrait-oriented | Touch optimization | Wide layouts, hover effects |
| Mobile (Android) | Small, portrait-oriented | Touch optimization | Wide layouts, hover effects |
| Teams Rooms | Very large | Visibility from distance | Small text, complex interactions |

### Adaptive Design Strategies
