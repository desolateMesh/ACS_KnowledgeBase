6. **Client Configuration**: Tools and procedures for configuring Outlook clients for optimal connectivity.

## Decision Tree for Connectivity Issues

```
START: Outlook Connectivity Issue
├── Is Outlook able to start?
│   ├── NO → Check for profile corruption:
│   │         1. Create new profile: Control Panel → Mail → Show Profiles → Add
│   │         2. Test connectivity with new profile
│   │         3. If successful, migrate data from corrupted profile
│   └── YES → Can Outlook connect to Exchange?
│       ├── NO → Is this a new installation or configuration?
│       │   ├── YES → Check Autodiscover configuration:
│       │   │         1. Verify DNS records for Autodiscover service
│       │   │         2. Test Autodiscover using Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer
│       │   │         3. Review Autodiscover Troubleshooting guide for detailed steps
│       │   └── NO → Did connectivity recently stop working?
│       │       ├── YES → Check for recent changes:
│       │       │         1. Network changes (firewalls, proxies)
│       │       │         2. Server-side changes (certificates, virtual directories)
│       │       │         3. Client-side updates or configuration changes
│       │       │         4. Use Exchange Online Connectivity Tests to diagnose
│       │       └── NO → Check basic connectivity:
│       │               1. Verify network connectivity to Exchange endpoints
│       │               2. Check authentication status and credentials
│       │               3. Validate proxy or firewall settings
│       │               4. See MAPI Over HTTP Configuration for protocol settings
│       └── YES → Is connectivity intermittent or slow?
│           ├── YES → Investigate performance issues:
│           │         1. Check network latency to Exchange servers
│           │         2. Review client-side performance (hardware, add-ins)
│           │         3. Validate protocol settings using MAPI Over HTTP Configuration guide
│           │         4. Check for throttling or resource constraints on server side
│           └── NO → Are specific features not working?
│               ├── YES → Identify feature-specific connectivity:
│               │         1. Shared mailboxes: Check permissions and delegation settings
│               │         2. Free/busy data: Check Availability service configuration
│               │         3. Directory services: Verify Global Address List access
│               └── NO → Perform validation testing:
│                       1. Use Exchange Online Connectivity Tests to verify all services
│                       2. Check application logs for subtle connection issues
│                       3. Monitor connection stability over time

## Connectivity Diagnostic Matrix

| Symptom | Primary Module | Diagnostic Approach | Common Resolution |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| "Cannot open your default email folders" | Autodiscover | Check Autodiscover endpoints and client configuration | Update DNS records, repair profile, or manually configure server settings |
| Connection times out | MAPI Over HTTP | Check network connectivity and latency | Adjust timeout settings, verify proxy configuration, ensure proper certificates |
| Repeated password prompts | Authentication | Check modern auth settings and token validity | Enable modern auth, update client, verify credential manager entries |
| "Disconnected" status in Outlook | Network | Test basic connectivity to Exchange endpoints | Verify VPN settings, check corporate network policies, test on different networks |
| Intermittent connection drops | Performance | Monitor network stability and resource usage | Optimize cache settings, update network drivers, check for conflicting applications |
| HTTPS certificate warnings | Security | Check certificate validity and trust | Update root certificates, check for certificate name mismatches, verify date/time settings |
