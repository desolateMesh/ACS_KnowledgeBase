#### Diagnostic Steps

1. **Verify account MFA status**:
   - Check user's MFA registration status in Azure AD:
   ```powershell
   # Connect to Microsoft Graph
   Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "User.Read.All", "UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All"
   
   # Get MFA methods for user
   Get-MgUserAuthenticationMethod -UserId user@contoso.com
   ```

2. **Review MFA method configuration**:
   - Verify registered authentication methods
   - Check if default sign-in method is properly set
   - Confirm device/app registration status

3. **Check for Conditional Access conflicts**:
   - Review Conditional Access policies in Azure AD
   - Identify policies that might block access or require additional authentication

4. **Test authentication flow**:
   - Try authentication from different devices/clients
   - Use alternative authentication methods if available
   - Check for time synchronization issues with authenticator apps
