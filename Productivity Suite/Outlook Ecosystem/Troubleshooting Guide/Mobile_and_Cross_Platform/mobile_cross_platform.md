# Mobile and Cross-Platform Troubleshooting

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive troubleshooting guidance for issues related to Outlook across mobile devices and various platforms. As the modern workplace becomes increasingly mobile and platform-diverse, ensuring consistent Outlook functionality across multiple devices and operating systems is essential.

## Mobile Device Issues

### Outlook Mobile App Connectivity

#### Symptoms
- "Unable to connect" or "Connection error" messages
- App shows "Reconnecting..." status indefinitely
- Emails and calendar not syncing on mobile devices
- Push notifications not working
- App frequently requests re-authentication

#### Diagnostic Steps

1. **Verify account status and settings**:
   - Check if account works in Outlook Web Access
   - Verify user credentials are correct and not expired
   - Confirm that the account hasn't been blocked or restricted

2. **Check network connectivity**:
   - Test basic internet connectivity on the device
   - Verify Wi-Fi or cellular data is functioning properly
   - Test alternative network connections (switch from Wi-Fi to cellular)
   - Check if VPN settings are interfering with connections

3. **Review app permissions**:
   - Verify Outlook has required device permissions:
     - Background app refresh (iOS)
     - Battery optimization exceptions (Android)
     - Data usage permissions
     - Notification permissions

4. **Check app version and compatibility**:
   - Confirm device meets minimum OS requirements
   - Verify Outlook app is updated to latest version
   - Check Microsoft 365 service status for known issues

#### Resolution Steps

1. **Basic connectivity troubleshooting**:
   - Force close and restart the Outlook app
   - Toggle airplane mode on/off to reset network connections
   - Restart the mobile device
   - Clear app cache (Android) or offload/reinstall app (iOS)

2. **Reset account configuration**:
   - Remove account from Outlook mobile app:
     1. Tap account avatar > Settings gear icon > Accounts
     2. Select problematic account
     3. Tap "Delete Account"
   - Re-add account with fresh authentication

3. **Resolve network-specific issues**:
   - If issue only occurs on specific networks:
     - Check firewall/proxy settings
     - Verify ports 443 and 80 are open for outbound traffic
     - Test using device's native mail app to compare behavior

4. **Fix push notification problems**:
   - Verify push notifications are enabled:
     - iOS: Settings > Notifications > Outlook
     - Android: Settings > Apps > Outlook > Notifications
   - Check background app restrictions:
     - iOS: Settings > General > Background App Refresh
     - Android: Settings > Apps > Outlook > Battery > Unrestricted

5. **Address persistent authentication issues**:
   - Reset device's credential cache
   - Check for Conditional Access policies that might be blocking mobile access
   - For Microsoft 365 accounts, verify modern authentication is properly configured

### Outlook Mobile Data Synchronization

#### Symptoms
- Only partial mailbox content appears on mobile devices
- Calendar events missing or appearing incorrectly
- Sync delays between actions on mobile and other platforms
- Sent items from mobile not appearing in other clients
- Search results incomplete or inconsistent

#### Diagnostic Steps

1. **Identify sync scope limitations**:
   - Check mobile app sync settings:
     - Focused Inbox configuration
     - Mail synchronization timeframe (1 week, 1 month, etc.)
     - Folder synchronization settings

2. **Test sync functionality**:
   - Create test item on desktop client and check mobile
   - Create test item on mobile and check desktop client
   - Track sync timing and completeness
   - Verify attachments and formatting are preserved

3. **Check account configuration**:
   - Verify account type (Exchange, Outlook.com, IMAP, etc.)
   - Some account types have inherent sync limitations
   - Confirm proper account protocol is being used

#### Resolution Steps

1. **Adjust sync settings**:
   - Modify mail sync duration:
     1. In Outlook mobile, tap avatar > Settings gear
     2. Select account > Sync Settings
     3. Adjust "Sync Emails For" duration
   - Configure folder sync settings:
     1. In account settings, tap "Folders to Sync"
     2. Select/deselect folders as needed

2. **Fix one-way sync issues**:
   - For sent items not appearing in other clients:
     - Check "Save Sent Items" settings
     - Verify sent folder location configuration

3. **Address calendar sync problems**:
   - Check calendar app permissions
   - Verify default calendar selection
   - For recurring meetings, check if exception handling works properly

4. **Resolve search limitations**:
   - Be aware of mobile search limitations:
     - Outlook mobile typically only searches downloaded content
     - Server-side search may not include all folders
   - Increase sync duration to include more searchable content

5. **Troubleshoot server-side sync issues**:
   - For Exchange accounts, check mailbox sync status:
   ```powershell
   # Check mobile device sync status
   Get-MobileDeviceStatistics -Mailbox user@contoso.com
   ```

### Mobile Device Management Integration

#### Symptoms

   - Check for Conditional Access policy hits

2. **Review app protection policies**:
   - Identify which app protection policies apply
   - Check for conflicts between policies
   - Verify policy assignments to users/groups

3. **Test with known-good device**:
   - Compare behavior with another enrolled device
   - Test with freshly enrolled device if available

#### Resolution Steps

4. **Configure app-specific settings**:
   - For Outlook-specific MDM issues:
     - Check data protection settings
     - Verify configured account types
     - Review data transfer policies between apps

5. **Troubleshoot compliance issues**:
   - In Intune console, check device compliance:
