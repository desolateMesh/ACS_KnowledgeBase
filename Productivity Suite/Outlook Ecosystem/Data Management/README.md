# Data Management

## Overview

The Data Management module provides comprehensive documentation, tools, and procedures for managing Outlook and Exchange data, including local OST files, archives, and retention policies. This documentation is essential for IT administrators and support specialists responsible for ensuring data integrity, compliance, and performance in Outlook environments.

## Components

The Data Management module includes the following key areas:

1. **OST File Repair Toolkit**: Tools and procedures for diagnosing, repairing, and optimizing Outlook OST (Offline Storage Table) files, which are essential for cached Exchange mode functionality.

2. **Archive Migration Strategies**: Methodologies and best practices for migrating mailbox archives, including PST to cloud archive migration and third-party tool evaluation.

3. **Retention Policy Configuration**: Guidelines for implementing and managing retention policies that control the lifecycle of email data for compliance and storage optimization.

4. **Mailbox Quota Management**: Procedures for managing mailbox size, including auto-expanding archives and user notification workflows.

5. **Bulk Operations**: Techniques for performing large-scale mailbox operations, including exports, imports, and eDiscovery case management.

6. **Compliance Features**: Implementation guidelines for message encryption, data loss prevention, and other compliance-related features.
