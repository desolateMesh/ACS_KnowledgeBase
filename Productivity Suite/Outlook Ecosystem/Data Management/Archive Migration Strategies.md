| In-Place Archives | On-premises Exchange archives | No internet dependency; Controlled data location | Storage limitations; Hardware costs; Management overhead |
| Third-Party Archives | Solutions from Veritas, Mimecast, etc. | Advanced compliance features; Specialized search | Vendor lock-in; Additional licensing costs |

### Pre-Migration Assessment

Before initiating any archive migration, conduct a thorough assessment:

1. **Inventory current archives**:
   - Size and number of PST files
   - Current storage locations
   - Age of data
   - Ownership and access requirements

2. **Determine compliance requirements**:
   - Legal hold obligations
   - Regulatory retention periods
   - eDiscovery capabilities needed
   - Privacy requirements

3. **Evaluate technical constraints**:
   - Network bandwidth availability
   - Storage capacity at destination
   - User impact during migration
   - Authentication and security requirements

4. **Define success criteria**:
   - Complete data transfer with integrity verification
   - Maintained folder structures
   - Preserved metadata (dates, categories, etc.)
   - Acceptable user disruption

## PST to Cloud Archive

### Migration Planning

A successful PST to cloud archive migration requires careful planning:

1. **Phase 1: Discovery and Inventory**
   - Locate all PST files using tools like:
     ```powershell
     # Find PST files across network shares
     $results = @()
     $drives = Get-PSDrive -PSProvider FileSystem
     foreach ($drive in $drives) {
         Write-Host "Scanning $($drive.Root) for PST files..."
         $files = Get-ChildItem -Path $drive.Root -Recurse -Include *.pst -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
         $results += $files
     }
     $results | Select-Object FullName, Length, LastWriteTime | Export-Csv -Path "C:\PSTInventory.csv" -NoTypeInformation
     ```
   - Identify connected vs. orphaned PSTs
   - Map PSTs to user mailboxes
   - Assess total migration volume

2. **Phase 2: Target Environment Preparation**
   - Enable archive mailboxes:
     ```powershell
     # Connect to Exchange Online
     Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName admin@contoso.com
     
     # Enable archive mailboxes for users with PSTs
     $users = Import-Csv "C:\PSTUsers.csv"
     foreach ($user in $users) {
         Enable-Mailbox -Identity $user.UserPrincipalName -Archive
         Write-Host "Enabled archive for $($user.UserPrincipalName)"
     }
     ```
   - Configure archive policies
   - Verify license assignments (E3/E5)
   - Enable auto-expanding archives if necessary:
     ```powershell
     # Enable auto-expanding archives
     $users = Import-Csv "C:\PSTUsers.csv"
     foreach ($user in $users) {
         Enable-Mailbox -Identity $user.UserPrincipalName -AutoExpandingArchive
         Write-Host "Enabled auto-expanding archive for $($user.UserPrincipalName)"
     }
     ```

3. **Phase 3: Migration Approach Selection**
   - Choose from network upload, drive shipping, or user-driven import
   - Create migration batches based on priority and size
   - Develop fallback plan for failures
   - Schedule migrations to minimize business impact

### Network Upload Approach

For organizations with good network connectivity to Microsoft 365:

1. **Set up Azure storage account**:
   - Create dedicated storage for PST staging
   - Configure appropriate security and access controls
   - Generate SAS tokens for secure access

2. **Install AzCopy tool**:
   - Download latest version from Microsoft
   - Verify proper authentication configuration
   - Test connectivity to Azure storage

3. **Upload PST files**:
   ```powershell
   # Example AzCopy v10 command for uploading PSTs
   azcopy copy "C:\PSTs\*" "https://pstmigration.blob.core.windows.net/pstfiles?[SAS_TOKEN]" --recursive
   ```

4. **Create CSV mapping file**:
   ```csv
   Workload,FilePath,Name,Mailbox,IsArchive,TargetRootFolder,ContentCodePage,SPFileContainer,SPManifestContainer,SPSiteUrl
   Exchange,https://pstmigration.blob.core.windows.net/pstfiles/user1.pst,user1.pst,user1@contoso.com,TRUE,/ImportedPST,,,,
   Exchange,https://pstmigration.blob.core.windows.net/pstfiles/user2.pst,user2.pst,user2@contoso.com,TRUE,/ImportedPST,,,,
   ```

5. **Create import job in Microsoft 365**:
   ```powershell
   # Connect to Exchange Online
   Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName admin@contoso.com
   
   # Create new import job
   New-MailboxImportRequest -FilePath "C:\PST-Mapping.csv" -Name "PST-Migration-Batch1"
   
   # Monitor progress
   Get-MailboxImportRequest | Get-MailboxImportRequestStatistics
   ```

### Drive Shipping Approach

For large migration volumes or limited bandwidth scenarios:

1. **Prepare external hard drives**:
   - Format with NTFS
   - Create folder structure for organization
   - Ensure physical security measures

2. **Copy PST files**:
   - Use robocopy for reliable transfers with logging:
     ```powershell
     robocopy "\\SourceServer\PSTs" "E:\PSTs" *.pst /E /ZB /R:5 /W:5 /LOG:C:\PST-Copy-Log.txt /TEE
     ```
   - Verify file integrity with checksums:
     ```powershell
     Get-FileHash "E:\PSTs\user1.pst" -Algorithm SHA256
     ```

3. **Ship drives to Microsoft**:
   - Follow Microsoft's drive shipping instructions
   - Use secure, tracked shipping methods
   - Include all required documentation
   - Maintain chain of custody logs

4. **Create import job**:
   - After Microsoft confirms drive receipt, create import job in the Microsoft 365 admin center
   - Use the provided manifest file
   - Monitor job progress

### User-Driven Approach

For smaller organizations or when individual user control is preferred:

1. **Configure Outlook PST import tool**:
   - Enable necessary permissions
   - Create user documentation

2. **Communicate with users**:
   - Provide clear instructions
   - Set deadlines and expectations
   - Offer support resources

3. **Monitor completion**:
   - Track user progress
   - Follow up on non-compliance
