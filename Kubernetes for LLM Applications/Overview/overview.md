# Overview

This document explains the approach to building scalable LLM applications with Kubernetes. It provides context, outlines overall objectives, and describes the architecture and benefits for deploying LLM apps.

**Key Points:**
- **Purpose:** To implement and maintain a robust, scalable, and efficient infrastructure for LLM applications.
- **Audience:** IT Support teams, DevOps engineers, and system administrators.
- **Outcome:** A documented process for deploying, monitoring, and troubleshooting LLM apps.

**Background:**
Large Language Model (LLM) applications are integral to modern AI services like chatbots, semantic search, and content generation. Kubernetes is used to orchestrate containerized applications, providing scalability, fault tolerance, and consistency across environments.

**Main Benefits:**
- **Scalability:** Auto-scaling and efficient resource utilization.
- **Fault-Tolerance:** Self-healing systems and high availability.
- **Deployment Consistency:** Uniform environments with CI/CD practices.
