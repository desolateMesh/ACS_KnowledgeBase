# Hybrid & Multi-Cloud Storage Architecture: Overview

## Introduction

Hybrid and multi-cloud storage architectures represent a strategic approach to enterprise data management that combines on-premises infrastructure with cloud-based storage services from one or more cloud service providers. This document provides a comprehensive overview of hybrid and multi-cloud storage concepts, benefits, challenges, and foundational principles to guide implementation decisions.

## Definitions

### Hybrid Cloud Storage

Hybrid cloud storage is an integrated storage architecture that combines:
- **On-premises storage systems** (private cloud, local data centers)
- **Public cloud storage services** (such as Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)

The components are connected through networking, APIs, VPNs, or dedicated connections (like Azure ExpressRoute, AWS Direct Connect) to create a unified storage environment.

### Multi-Cloud Storage

Multi-cloud storage refers to the strategic use of storage services from two or more public cloud providers simultaneously. This approach may include:
- **Primary and secondary cloud providers** for different workloads or data types
- **Specialized storage services** from different providers based on specific features or regional availability
- **Distributed data architectures** that span multiple cloud environments

### Hybrid Multi-Cloud Storage

This combined approach leverages both hybrid (on-premises + public cloud) and multi-cloud (multiple public clouds) strategies to create a comprehensive storage ecosystem that optimizes for flexibility, resilience, and feature-specific advantages.
