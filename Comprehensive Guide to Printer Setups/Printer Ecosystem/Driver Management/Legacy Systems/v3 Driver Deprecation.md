# v3 Driver Deprecation

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the roadmap, tooling, and guidelines for deprecating **v3 printer drivers** across the organizationâ€™s fleet. It enables AI-driven agents to:
- Identify devices using v3 drivers.  
- Plan and execute automated migration to updated driver versions (v4+).  
- Monitor progress, detect failures, and trigger rollbacks if necessary.

## 2. Scope
- **Driver Versions**: All v3.x.x printer drivers (platform-specific and vendor-specific).  
- **Environments**: Windows (Spooler-based), Linux/macOS (CUPS), and embedded edge nodes.  
- **Stakeholders**: Systems administrators, print gateway services, AI automation bots, end users.

## 3. Definitions
- **v3 Driver**: Legacy driver series identified by major version prefix `3.x`.  
- **v4+ Driver**: Supported driver versions (4.0.0 and above).  
- **Edge Node**: Local print gateway device running Linux with CUPS.  
- **Spooler Inventory**: Central database of installed drivers and printer assignments.

## 4. Deprecation Timeline
| Phase               | Start Date      | End Date        | Description                                |
|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Discovery**       | 2025-05-01      | 2025-05-15      | Scan inventory, identify v3 driver usage.  |
| **Validation**      | 2025-05-16      | 2025-05-22      | Test v4+ drivers in lab environment.       |
| **Pilot Rollout**   | 2025-05-23      | 2025-06-05      | Deploy to small subset (10% of devices).   |
| **Full Migration**  | 2025-06-06      | 2025-07-01      | Automate driver upgrades organization-wide.|
| **End of Life**     | 2025-07-02      | 2025-07-02      | Disable v3 drivers; remove from repos.     |

## 5. Impact Assessment
| Platform  | Devices Affected    | Criticality | Notes                                        |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Windows   | 2,000 workstations  | High        | Spooler service must restart after upgrade.  |
| Linux     | 150 edge nodes      | Medium      | CUPS reload required; test Ghostscript chain.|
| macOS     | 300 laptops         | Low         | v4 drivers bundled in macOS 12+             |

## 6. Migration Plan

### 6.1 Discovery & Inventory
```powershell
# Query Windows driver inventory
Get-PrinterDriver | Where-Object Version -like '3.*' | Export-Csv -Path v3_drivers.csv
```

```bash
# On Linux edge nodes: list v3 PPDs
grep -R "Version: 3." /etc/cups/ppd/ > /tmp/v3_ppd_list.txt
```

### 6.2 Validation & Testing
- Deploy v4+ drivers in isolated lab network.  
- Define test cases: duplex, color, stapling.  
- Automate tests using Python script (`pytest` + `pycups`).

### 6.3 Automated Rollout (Ansible)
```yaml
- name: Upgrade v3 drivers to v4
  hosts: all_printers
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Check installed driver version
      command: lpinfo --make-and-model
      register: driver_info
    - name: Install v4 driver if v3 detected
      when: "'3.' in driver_info.stdout"
      package:
        name: printer-driver-v4
        state: present
    - name: Restart CUPS
      service:
        name: cups
        state: restarted
```

### 6.4 Fallback & Rollback
- Maintain snapshot of existing v3 driver packages.  
- Rollback playbook:
```yaml
- name: Rollback to v3 driver
  hosts: all_printers
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Remove v4 driver
      package:
        name: printer-driver-v4
        state: absent
    - name: Reinstall v3 driver
      package:
        name: printer-driver-v3
        state: present
    - name: Restart print service
      service:
        name: cups
        state: restarted
```  
- Trigger rollback on >10% failure rate within pilot group.

## 7. Decision Matrix
| Condition                           | Action                              |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| v3 driver on High-Criticality host  | Manual review before upgrade        |
| v3 driver on Lab node               | Immediate automatic upgrade         |
| v3 driver on macOS 12+              | Skip (v4 bundled natively)          |
| Upgrade failure count > 5%          | Pause rollout, trigger rollback     |

## 8. Communication & Training
- **Automated Notifications**: Email to print-admin list at each phase transition.  
- **User Alerts**: Pop-up notifications on Windows via GPO.  
- **Training Docs**: Link to troubleshooting guide for v4 drivers.

## 9. Monitoring & Reporting
- **Metrics**: Upgrade success rate, rollback triggers, service restarts.  
- **Dashboards**: Grafana panels pulling from Spooler Inventory DB.  
- **Alerts**: PagerDuty if failure rate > 10% for 30 minutes.
