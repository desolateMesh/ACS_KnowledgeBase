## Introduction to TLS 1.3

TLS 1.3 was finalized in August 2018 and offers significant improvements over previous versions. In printer ecosystems, the protocol secures network communications between printers, print servers, management systems, and client devices.

### Core Changes from TLS 1.2

- **Streamlined Handshake**: Reduced connection time from two round-trips to one
- **Improved Privacy**: Encrypts more of the handshake process
- **Removed Legacy Cryptography**: Eliminated vulnerable algorithms (RC4, DES, 3DES, MD5, SHA-1, etc.)
- **Forward Secrecy**: Mandatory by default, protecting past communications
- **0-RTT Mode**: Optional resumption feature for faster reconnections

### Security Enhancements

- Simplified cryptographic options, removing insecure ciphers
- Digital signatures on more handshake elements
- More robust key derivation functions

## Key Advantages in Printer Environments

### Enhanced Security for Sensitive Documents

- **End-to-end Encryption**: Secures document content from client to printer
- **Protection Against MitM Attacks**: Prevents interception of print jobs containing sensitive information
- **Secure Print Authentication**: Protects user credentials during authentication with printer systems

### Performance Improvements

- **Faster Connection Establishment**: Reduced handshake time improves responsiveness of printer services
- **Lower Overhead**: Streamlined protocol requires less processing power on printer firmware
- **Efficient Reconnections**: Session resumption features benefit multiple document printing scenarios

### Simplified Compliance

- **GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS Alignment**: Aids in meeting regulatory requirements for documents containing regulated data
- **Audit Trail Support**: Enables better logging and verification of secure printing activities
- **Standardized Security**: Simplifies security architecture documentation

## Configuration Steps

### Print Server Configuration

#### Windows Server Configuration

```powershell
# Enable TLS 1.3 and disable older protocols via Registry
$protocols = @{
    "TLS 1.3" = @{
        Enabled = 1
        DisabledByDefault = 0
    }
    "TLS 1.2" = @{
        Enabled = 1
        DisabledByDefault = 0
    }
    "TLS 1.1" = @{
        Enabled = 0
        DisabledByDefault = 1
    }
    "TLS 1.0" = @{
        Enabled = 0
        DisabledByDefault = 1
    }
    "SSL 3.0" = @{
        Enabled = 0
        DisabledByDefault = 1
    }
    "SSL 2.0" = @{
        Enabled = 0
        DisabledByDefault = 1
    }
}

$protocols.GetEnumerator() | ForEach-Object {
    $protocol = $_.Key
    $values = $_.Value
    
    foreach ($client in @("Client", "Server")) {
        $regKeyPath = "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\$protocol\$client"
        
        if (!(Test-Path $regKeyPath)) {
            New-Item -Path $regKeyPath -Force | Out-Null
        }
        
        New-ItemProperty -Path $regKeyPath -Name "Enabled" -Value $values.Enabled -PropertyType DWORD -Force | Out-Null
        New-ItemProperty -Path $regKeyPath -Name "DisabledByDefault" -Value $values.DisabledByDefault -PropertyType DWORD -Force | Out-Null
    }
}

# Configure preferred cipher suites (PowerShell 5.1+)
$cipherSuitesOrder = @(
    'TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384',
    'TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256',
    'TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256',
    'TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384',
    'TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256'
)
$cipherSuitesAsString = [string]::Join(',', $cipherSuitesOrder)
New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Cryptography\Configuration\SSL\00010002' -Name 'Functions' -Value $cipherSuitesAsString -PropertyType String -Force | Out-Null

# Restart Print Spooler service to apply changes
Restart-Service -Name Spooler
```

#### Linux Print Server (CUPS) Configuration

```bash
# Edit CUPS configuration file
sudo nano /etc/cups/cupsd.conf

# Add/modify these lines:
SSLProtocol TLSv1.3 TLSv1.2
SSLCipherSuite HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5:!RC4
SSLOptions +StrictRequire

# For newer CUPS versions, you might use:
TLSMinVersion 1.3

# Restart CUPS
sudo systemctl restart cups
```

### Printer Configuration

Most enterprise printers offer configuration via:

1. **Web Interface**: Typically found at http://[printer-IP-address]
2. **Control Panel**: Physical interface on the printer
3. **Management Software**: Centralized tools provided by manufacturers

#### Generic Steps (Adapt for specific printer models)

1. Access the printer's administrative interface
2. Navigate to Security or Network Security settings
3. Locate TLS/SSL Configuration
4. Enable TLS 1.3 (may require selecting "Enable latest TLS version")
5. Disable older protocols (TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, SSL)
6. Upload or generate a suitable certificate
7. Configure cipher preferences, if available
8. Save changes and restart printer network services

#### Example: HP Enterprise Printer Configuration

1. Access the printer's Embedded Web Server (EWS)
2. Navigate to the "Security" tab
3. Select "Network Security" or "Web Services Security"
4. Find "SSL/TLS Protocol" settings
5. Check "Enable TLS 1.3" and "Enable TLS 1.2"
6. Uncheck "Enable TLS 1.1" and "Enable TLS 1.0"
7. Under "Cipher Specification", select or prioritize:
   - TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
   - TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
   - TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
8. Apply changes and restart printer

## Printer-Specific Considerations

### Manufacturer-Specific Implementation Notes

#### HP

- Most LaserJet Enterprise models from 2019 support TLS 1.3 with firmware updates
- Use HP Web Jetadmin for centralized TLS configuration
- Authentication via LDAP over TLS requires specific configuration
- Reference: HP Security Bulletin HPSB-2019-09

#### Xerox

- TLS 1.3 support varies by model and controller version
- AltaLink and VersaLink series support TLS 1.3 with latest firmware
- Use Xerox CentreWare for centralized configuration
- Note: Some models require specific cipher enablement
- Reference: Xerox Security Information Bulletin XRX19-12

#### Canon

- imageRUNNER ADVANCE series supports TLS 1.3 with firmware v3.11+
- Use Canon imageWARE Enterprise Management Console for fleet updates
- Special considerations for MEAP applications using TLS
- Reference: Canon Security Advisory CSA-2019-003

#### Ricoh

- Most models with Smart Operation Panel support TLS 1.3
- Older models may only support up to TLS 1.2
- Use Web Image Monitor or Device Manager NX for configuration
- Reference: Ricoh Security Advisory RSAS-2019-007

### Resource Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: TLS 1.3 handshakes consume approximately 10-15% less RAM than TLS 1.2
- **CPU Impact**: Initial connection establishment uses more CPU resources, but subsequent data transfer is more efficient
- **Firmware Size**: TLS 1.3 libraries may increase firmware size by 5-10%
- **Recommendation**: Update devices with at least 512MB RAM for optimal performance

## Certificate Management

### Certificate Requirements

- **Key Algorithm**: ECDSA (preferred) or RSA with 2048+ bit keys
- **Signature Algorithm**: SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512
- **Certificate Fields**:
  - SubjectAlternativeName must include printer IP and/or hostname
  - KeyUsage must include digitalSignature and keyEncipherment
  - ExtendedKeyUsage must include serverAuth
- **Validity Period**: Maximum 2 years (per modern browser requirements)

### Certificate Implementation Methods

#### Self-Signed Certificates

```bash
# Example: Generate a self-signed certificate with OpenSSL
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout printer_key.pem -out printer_cert.pem -days 365 \
-subj "/CN=printer.example.com" \
-addext "subjectAltName=DNS:printer.example.com,IP:192.168.1.100"
```

**Note**: Self-signed certificates require client-side trust configuration and are generally not recommended for production environments.

#### Enterprise CA Integration

1. **Create Certificate Signing Request (CSR) on printer**:
   - Access printer web interface
   - Navigate to security settings
   - Locate certificate management
   - Generate CSR with appropriate attributes
   - Download the CSR file

2. **Submit to Enterprise CA**:
   - Use CA web interface or command-line tools to submit the CSR
   - Specify Web Server or TLS Server template
   - Include appropriate Subject Alternative Names

3. **Import Signed Certificate**:
   - Download the signed certificate from CA
   - Import to printer via web interface
   - Import any intermediate certificates if required
   - Verify the certificate chain

#### Certificate Deployment Automation

For large printer fleets, consider:

- **ACME Protocol**: If supported by printer and internal CA
- **SCEP**: Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol for automated renewal
- **MDM Solutions**: Mobile Device Management tools with certificate provisioning
- **Manufacturer Tools**: HP Web Jetadmin, Xerox CentreWare, etc.

### Certificate Validation

Configure printers to validate client certificates when applicable:

```
# Example configuration for client certificate validation (pseudocode)
cipher_suite = TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
client_auth = required
client_ca_file = /etc/ssl/certs/company-ca.pem
verify_depth = 3
session_tickets = on
stapling = on
```

## Compatibility Considerations

### Legacy System Integration

| Client System | Compatibility Notes |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Windows 7     | Not compatible with TLS 1.3, requires upgrading or maintaining a TLS 1.2 fallback |
| Windows 8.1   | Partial support with updates, not recommended |
| macOS < 10.14 | No native TLS 1.3 support |
| Java < 11     | Applications using older Java runtimes need updates |
| IE 11         | No TLS 1.3 support, recommend modern browser |
| Old Mobile OS | iOS < 12.2 and Android < 10 lack TLS 1.3 support |

### Fallback Strategies

- **Protocol Negotiation**: Allow TLS 1.2 fallback only where absolutely necessary
- **Separate Print Queues**: Create dedicated queues for legacy systems with appropriate protocol settings
- **Print Gateway**: Implement middleware that accepts TLS 1.2 connections and forwards via TLS 1.3
- **Client Updates**: Prioritize updating client systems rather than weakening server security

### Monitoring TLS Version Usage

Deploy monitoring to track TLS version usage:

```powershell
# Example: PowerShell script to analyze TLS connections to print servers
Get-NetTCPConnection -State Established | 
Where-Object { $_.RemotePort -eq 443 -or $_.RemotePort -eq 631 } |
ForEach-Object {
    $process = Get-Process -Id $_.OwningProcess
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        Process = $process.Name
        PID = $_.OwningProcess
        LocalAddress = $_.LocalAddress
        LocalPort = $_.LocalPort
        RemoteAddress = $_.RemoteAddress
        RemotePort = $_.RemotePort
        State = $_.State
    }
} | Export-Csv -Path "PrinterTLSConnections.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Implementation Issues

#### Handshake Failures

**Symptoms**:
- Print jobs fail to submit
- "Unable to connect securely" errors
- Slow connection establishment

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. Verify TLS versions enabled on both client and printer
2. Check certificate validity and expiration
3. Validate cipher suite compatibility
4. Test with simplified configuration (e.g., fewer restrictions)
5. Capture network traffic with Wireshark for detailed analysis

```bash
# Using OpenSSL to test TLS connection to printer
openssl s_client -connect printer.example.com:443 -tls1_3
```

#### Certificate Problems

**Symptoms**:
- Security warnings on print clients
- Jobs submit but fail to complete
- Authentication failures

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. Verify certificate hasn't expired
2. Check that certificate Common Name or SAN matches the printer's hostname/IP
3. Validate the full certificate chain (including intermediate certificates)
4. Confirm certificate key usage extensions are correct
5. Check system time on printer (certificate validation depends on accurate time)

#### Performance Issues

**Symptoms**:
- Slower than expected print job submission
- High CPU utilization on printer
- Delayed first page out time

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. Update printer firmware to latest version
2. Check printer memory and resource utilization
3. Consider enabling session resumption features
4. Adjust cipher suite preferences for better performance
5. Monitor network latency between clients and printers

### Diagnostic Tools

- **Network Packet Analysis**: Wireshark with TLS 1.3 decryption capability
- **TLS Testing**: OpenSSL command-line tools, testssl.sh
- **Certificate Validation**: OpenSSL, certutil
- **Printer Diagnostics**: Manufacturer-specific diagnostic pages and logs

### Common Error Codes

| Error Code | Description | Possible Solutions |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER | Certificate issuer not trusted | Import CA certificates to client trust store |
| SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN | Hostname mismatch | Ensure certificate SAN includes printer hostname/IP |
| ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH | No common TLS version or cipher | Update firmware or enable compatible ciphers |
| SEC_ERROR_EXPIRED_CERTIFICATE | Certificate expired | Renew certificate |
| SSL_ERROR_NO_CYPHER_OVERLAP | No common cipher suites | Adjust cipher suite configuration |
| HANDSHAKE_FAILURE (40) | General TLS negotiation failure | Check logs, ensure algorithms supported by both sides |

## Compliance and Audit

### Regulatory Considerations

#### GDPR Requirements

- TLS 1.3 helps satisfy Article 32 requirements for "appropriate technical measures"
- Document TLS 1.3 implementation as part of data protection impact assessments
- Include printer communication security in data processing documentation

#### PCI-DSS Alignment

- PCI-DSS v4.0 requires "strong cryptography" for transmitted cardholder data
- TLS 1.3 satisfies this requirement when implemented correctly
- Document printer encryption as part of PCI compliance artifacts

#### HIPAA Security Rule

- TLS 1.3 helps meet transmission security requirements (45 CFR § 164.312(e)(1))
- Include in security management process documentation
- Document in risk analysis and management procedures

### Logging and Monitoring

#### Print Server Logging

```powershell
# Example: Configure Windows Server printing security audit logging
auditpol /set /subcategory:"Detailed File Share" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /subcategory:"Other Object Access Events" /success:enable /failure:enable

# Configure event forwarding to SIEM
wecutil qc /q
```

#### Recommended Monitoring Events

| Event Type | What to Monitor | Purpose |
|------------|-----------------|---------|
| TLS Handshakes | Success/failure rates | Detect configuration or certificate issues |
| Protocol Downgrades | Attempts to use older TLS versions | Identify potential attacks or compatibility issues |
| Certificate Warnings | Expiration, validation failures | Proactive certificate management |
| Authentication Events | Failed secure print authentications | Detect potential unauthorized access attempts |
| Print Job Encryption | Jobs sent unencrypted | Compliance gap detection |

### Audit Procedures

Implement quarterly review of:

1. **TLS Configuration**:
   - Verify only TLS 1.2+ enabled
   - Check cipher suite preferences
   - Validate against current best practices

2. **Certificate Management**:
   - Audit certificate validity periods
   - Verify certificate parameters match standards
   - Check for upcoming expirations

3. **Vulnerability Scanning**:
   - Test printer TLS implementations against known vulnerabilities
   - Verify secure response to malformed TLS handshakes
   - Check for weak ciphers or downgrade possibilities
