## Risk Assessment

### Data Exposure Vectors

- **Document Caching**: Most enterprise multifunction printers (MFPs) cache documents before/after printing
- **Print Logs**: Detailed logs often contain metadata about documents, users, and print activities
- **User Information**: Address books, authentication data, and user credentials
- **Network Configuration**: Stored WiFi passwords, VPN settings, and other network parameters
- **End-of-life Risks**: Decommissioned printers with unencrypted drives expose historical data

### Security Impact Levels

| Risk Level | Description | Examples |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Critical | Direct exposure of regulated or confidential data | Healthcare records, financial statements, HR documents |
| High | Significant metadata leakage | Document names, user patterns, departmental activities |
| Medium | Configuration and credential exposure | Network settings, non-privileged accounts |
| Low | Minimal sensitive information | Public document logs, general usage statistics |

## Encryption Standards and Requirements

### Minimum Encryption Requirements

- **Algorithm**: AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard) minimum for all new printer deployments
- **Mode of Operation**: CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) preferred
- **Key Length**: 256-bit minimum, with no weak key exceptions
- **Implementation**: Full-disk encryption (FDE) rather than file-level or folder-level encryption
- **Certification**: FIPS 140-2 (or later) validated encryption modules strongly recommended

### Industry Compliance Alignments

| Regulation | Encryption Requirement | Implementation Notes |
|------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| HIPAA | Data at rest encryption required | Must include audit logs of encryption status |
| PCI DSS | AES-128 minimum, AES-256 recommended | Must include key rotation procedures |
| GDPR | "Appropriate" encryption (AES-256 recommended) | Must document encryption methodology |
| NIST 800-171 | FIPS 140-2 validated modules | Requires periodic encryption verification |
| ISO 27001 | Risk-based encryption approach | Must align with organizational risk assessment |
