## Introduction

The Role-Based Access Matrix serves as the authoritative reference for implementing secure access controls across all printer systems. This framework is designed to:

- Enforce the principle of least privilege
- Maintain separation of duties
- Provide granular access based on job responsibilities
- Enable efficient access provisioning and de-provisioning
- Support audit and compliance requirements
- Prevent unauthorized access to printing resources and confidential documents

## Access Control Principles

Our printer ecosystem access controls are governed by these core principles:

1. **Least Privilege**: Users should only have access to the minimum resources and functions necessary to perform their job.
2. **Need-to-Know**: Access to printing capabilities and configurations should be restricted based on business requirements.
3. **Separation of Duties**: Critical functions should be divided among different roles to prevent conflicts of interest.
4. **Default Deny**: Access is denied by default and explicitly granted based on role requirements.
5. **Administrative Delegation**: Administration rights are carefully delegated based on responsibility areas.
6. **Accountability**: All access-related activities must be logged and attributable to individual users.

## Integration with Identity Management

The Role-Based Access Matrix is implemented through integration with the organization's Identity and Access Management (IAM) system:

### Technical Implementation

1. **Directory Service Integration**
   - Active Directory/LDAP groups mapped to printer roles
   - Automatic provisioning based on HR system updates
   - Single sign-on (SSO) implementation for seamless access

2. **Authentication Methods**
   - Username/password with MFA for remote access
   - Badge/card authentication for physical printer access
   - Certificate-based authentication for administrative functions

3. **Federation Standards**
   - SAML 2.0 support for third-party integration
   - OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect for web applications

### Access Synchronization

1. **Change Propagation**
   - Changes in role assignments propagate within 15 minutes
