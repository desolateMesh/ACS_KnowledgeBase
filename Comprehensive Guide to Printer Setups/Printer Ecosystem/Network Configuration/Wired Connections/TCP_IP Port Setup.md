## Basic Concepts

### What is a TCP/IP Port?

In printer networking, a TCP/IP port serves as a communication endpoint that allows the operating system to send print jobs to a printer over the network. The port defines:

- The printer's IP address or hostname
- The communication protocol (typically RAW or LPR)
- The port number (typically 9100 for RAW, 515 for LPR)

### Types of TCP/IP Printer Ports

1. **Standard TCP/IP Port** - The most common port type, used for direct IP communication
2. **LPR Port** - An older protocol that uses Line Printer Remote (LPR) services
3. **Internet Printing Protocol (IPP)** - Modern protocol that supports additional features
4. **Web Services for Devices (WSD)** - Microsoft's discovery and communication protocol

### Port vs. Protocol

- **Port**: The logical connection point identified by a number (e.g., 9100)
- **Protocol**: The set of rules governing communication (e.g., RAW, LPR, IPP)

## Prerequisites

Before setting up a TCP/IP port, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

### Network Requirements

- The printer must have a valid IP address on the network
- Network connectivity must be established between the computer and printer
- Required network ports must be open on any firewalls between the devices:
  - Port 9100 for RAW printing
  - Port 515 for LPR printing
  - Port 631 for IPP printing
  - Port 5357 for WSD

### Printer Requirements

- The printer must have TCP/IP enabled in its configuration
- The printer should have a static IP address or DHCP reservation to prevent IP changes
- The printer's firmware should be updated to the latest version

### System Requirements

- Administrator privileges on the computer setting up the printer
- Proper printer drivers installed or available for installation
- Print spooler service running on the computer

## Standard TCP/IP Port Creation

### Using Windows GUI

1. Open **Devices and Printers** (Windows 10) or **Printers & Scanners** (Windows 11)
2. Click **Add a printer**
3. Select **Add a local printer or network printer with manual settings**
4. Choose **Create a new port** and select **Standard TCP/IP Port** from the dropdown
5. Enter the printer's IP address or hostname
6. Provide a port name or use the default (IP_xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)
7. Choose whether to automatically detect the printer type or specify it manually
8. Complete the wizard by selecting the appropriate driver

### Using PowerShell (Windows)

```powershell
# Add a TCP/IP printer port
Add-PrinterPort -Name "IP_192.168.1.100" -PrinterHostAddress "192.168.1.100"

# Add a printer using the port
Add-Printer -Name "Network Printer" -DriverName "HP Universal Printing PCL 6" -PortName "IP_192.168.1.100"
```

### Using Command Line (Windows)

```cmd
cscript %WINDIR%\System32\Printing_Admin_Scripts\en-US\prnport.vbs -a -r IP_192.168.1.100 -h 192.168.1.100 -o raw -n 9100
```

### Using CUPS (Linux/Unix)

```bash
# Install CUPS if not already installed
sudo apt-get install cups

# Add printer via command line
sudo lpadmin -p PrinterName -E -v socket://192.168.1.100:9100 -m drv:///sample.drv/generic.ppd
```

## Automation and Scripting

### PowerShell Scripting

```powershell
# Function to set up a TCP/IP printer port and printer
function Add-NetworkPrinter {
    param(
        [string]$PrinterName,
        [string]$IPAddress,
        [string]$DriverName,
        [string]$Location = "",
        [string]$Comment = "",
        [int]$PortNumber = 9100,
        [string]$Protocol = "RAW"
    )
    
    $PortName = "IP_$IPAddress"
    
    # Create the port if it doesn't exist
    if (-not (Get-PrinterPort -Name $PortName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) {
        Write-Host "Creating port $PortName for $IPAddress..."
        Add-PrinterPort -Name $PortName -PrinterHostAddress $IPAddress -PortNumber $PortNumber
    }
    
    # Create the printer if it doesn't exist
    if (-not (Get-Printer -Name $PrinterName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) {
        Write-Host "Creating printer $PrinterName..."
        Add-Printer -Name $PrinterName -DriverName $DriverName -PortName $PortName -Location $Location -Comment $Comment
    } else {
        Write-Host "Updating printer $PrinterName..."
        Set-Printer -Name $PrinterName -DriverName $DriverName -PortName $PortName -Location $Location -Comment $Comment
    }
    
    Write-Host "Printer setup completed successfully."
}
