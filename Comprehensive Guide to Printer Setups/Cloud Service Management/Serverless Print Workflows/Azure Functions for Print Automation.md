# Azure Functions for Print Automation

This document provides guidance on implementing print automation workflows using Azure Functions.

## Azure Functions Fundamentals for Printing
- Event-driven execution model
- Consumption plan vs. Premium plan considerations
- Binding types for print workflows
- Durable functions for complex print processes

## Architecture Components
- Azure Functions core
- Storage Queues/Service Bus
- Blob Storage for print jobs
- Azure AD for authentication
- Application Insights for monitoring
- Key Vault for secrets management

## Implementation Patterns
1. Print job submission endpoints
2. Queue-triggered processing
3. Timer-based batch processing
4. Event Grid integration for printer events
5. Webhook receivers for printer callbacks

## Code Examples
- Print job submission function
- PDF processing and conversion
- Printer command generation
- Status monitoring function
- Error handling implementations

## Integration Scenarios
- Universal Print API connections
- Direct printer communication
- Print server intermediaries
- Enterprise application integration
- Mobile client support

## Security and Governance
- Azure AD authentication flows
- Managed identities configuration
- RBAC implementation
- Audit logging setup
- Compliance considerations
