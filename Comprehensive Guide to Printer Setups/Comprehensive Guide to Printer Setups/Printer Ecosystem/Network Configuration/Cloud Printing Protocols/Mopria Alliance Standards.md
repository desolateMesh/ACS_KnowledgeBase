# Mopria Alliance Standards

This document outlines the Mopria Alliance printing standards and their implementation in enterprise environments.

## Overview of Mopria Alliance

### History and Mission

The Mopria Alliance was established in September 2013 as a Delaware non-profit membership corporation by four founding members: Canon, HP, Samsung, and Xerox. It operates as a 501(c)(6) nonprofit corporation with a clear mission: to provide universal standards and solutions for scan and print technologies, removing interoperability barriers and market confusion.

Initially focused on addressing the challenges of printing from Android mobile devices, the Alliance has since expanded its scope to create standards for printing and scanning across multiple platforms. The Alliance's core mission is to enable seamless printing and scanning regardless of device, operating system, or printer brand.

The Mopria Alliance aims to eliminate the need for users to install brand-specific printer drivers or software, making the printing and scanning experience simple and consistent across a wide range of devices and printers.

### Member Organizations
