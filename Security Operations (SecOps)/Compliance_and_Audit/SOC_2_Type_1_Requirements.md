# SOC 2 Type 1 Requirements

## Executive Summary

SOC 2 Type 1 (Service Organization Control 2 Type 1) is a compliance framework developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) that evaluates an organization's information systems at a specific point in time. This document provides comprehensive guidance for organizations preparing for SOC 2 Type 1 certification, outlining requirements, implementation strategies, and best practices necessary for successful compliance.

### Key Differentiators
- **Type 1 vs Type 2**: SOC 2 Type 1 evaluates the design of controls at a specific point in time, while Type 2 evaluates the operating effectiveness of controls over a period (typically 6-12 months)
- **Point-in-Time Assessment**: Type 1 provides assurance that controls are suitably designed to meet the trust services criteria
- **Foundation for Type 2**: Successful Type 1 certification sets the groundwork for eventual Type 2 compliance
