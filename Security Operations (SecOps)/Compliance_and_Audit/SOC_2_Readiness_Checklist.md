# SOC 2 Readiness Checklist

## Introduction

SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2) is a framework for managing customer data based on five Trust Service Criteria (TSCs). This comprehensive checklist serves as a decision-making guide for AI agents and security teams to assess, prepare, and maintain SOC 2 compliance.

### Purpose and Scope

**Purpose**: This document provides a systematic approach to achieving and maintaining SOC 2 compliance, enabling automated assessments and decision-making for security operations.

**Scope**: Covers all five Trust Service Criteria:
- Security
- Availability 
- Processing Integrity
- Confidentiality
- Privacy

### Key Decision Points for AI Agents

When evaluating SOC 2 readiness, AI agents should consider:
1. **Current State Assessment**: Evaluate existing controls against requirements
2. **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing components and prioritize remediation
3. **Risk Scoring**: Assign risk levels to gaps (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
4. **Remediation Timeline**: Estimate time and resources needed
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Establish ongoing compliance verification

## Pre-Assessment Preparation

### 1. Define Audit Scope

**Decision Criteria**:
- Which systems process customer data?
- What services are customer-facing?
- Which TSCs are applicable to your organization?

**Example Scope Definition**:
```yaml
audit_scope:
  systems:
    - Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
    - Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
    - Cloud Infrastructure (Azure/AWS)
    - Authentication Systems
  trust_service_criteria:
    - security: required
    - availability: required
    - processing_integrity: optional
    - confidentiality: required
    - privacy: required
  exclusions:
    - Internal HR systems
    - Marketing websites
```

### 2. Establish System Boundaries

**Key Considerations**:
- Physical and logical boundaries
- Third-party integrations
- Data flow mapping
- Infrastructure components

**System Boundary Template**:
```json
{
  "system_boundary": {
    "internal_systems": [
      "Production Servers",
      "Database Clusters",
      "Application Services"
    ],
    "external_interfaces": [
      "Payment Gateways",
      "Third-party APIs",
      "Customer Portals"
    ],
    "network_boundaries": {
      "dmz": "10.0.1.0/24",
      "internal": "10.0.2.0/24",
      "management": "10.0.3.0/24"
