## 📊 SLA Monitoring and Measurement

### Key Performance Indicators

**Core SLA Metrics:**

| Metric | Definition | Calculation Method | Target Example |
|--------|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Response Time Compliance | Percentage of tickets with response time within SLA | (Tickets meeting response SLA ÷ Total tickets) × 100 | ≥95% |
| Resolution Time Compliance | Percentage of tickets with resolution time within SLA | (Tickets meeting resolution SLA ÷ Total tickets) × 100 | ≥90% |
| First Contact Resolution Rate | Percentage of issues resolved during first interaction | (Tickets resolved at first contact ÷ Total tickets) × 100 | ≥75% |
| Service Availability | Percentage of time service is operational | ((Total hours - Downtime hours) ÷ Total hours) × 100 | ≥99.9% |
| Customer Satisfaction | Average user rating of support experience | Average of survey scores on 1-5 scale | ≥4.5 |

**Supporting Operational Metrics:**

| Metric | Purpose | Relationship to SLA |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| Average Speed of Answer | Measures initial responsiveness for phone support | Influences user satisfaction and perception of service |
| Abandonment Rate | Percentage of users who disconnect before reaching support | Indicator of accessibility issues that may affect SLA perception |
| Average Handle Time | Time spent actively working on an incident | Efficiency metric that affects capacity to meet SLA targets |
| Backlog Volume and Aging | Number and age of open tickets | Leading indicator of potential SLA compliance issues |
| Escalation Rate | Percentage of tickets requiring higher-level support | Affects resolution time compliance and resource planning |

### Measurement Methodology

**Data Collection Sources:**
- Ticketing system timestamps and metrics
- Phone system call statistics
- Customer satisfaction surveys
- Quality assurance evaluations
- System monitoring tools
- Self-service portal analytics
- Workforce management systems

**SLA Timer Rules:**

| Timer Element | Business Rule |
|---------------|--------------|
| Start Time | Creation timestamp of ticket in system |
| Pause Conditions | Waiting for user response, vendor action, or approved deferral |
| Resume Triggers | Receipt of requested information or vendor response |
| Stop Time | Resolution confirmed and ticket closed |
| Business Hours Calculation | According to service window definition for priority level |
| Exclusions | Agreed maintenance windows, force majeure events, user delays |

**Measurement Accuracy Considerations:**
- Timestamp precision and consistency
- Time zone handling for distributed support
- Data validation and cleansing procedures
- Manual timer adjustments and approvals
- Integration points between systems
- Outage classification standardization
- Handling of cross-midnight incidents

**Calculation Methodologies:**

Basic SLA Compliance:
```
SLA Compliance % = (Tickets Meeting SLA Target ÷ Total Tickets) × 100
```

Weighted SLA Compliance:
```
Weighted Compliance % = Σ(Priority Weighting × Priority-Level Compliance %)

Example Weightings:
P1 (Critical): 40%
P2 (High): 30%
P3 (Medium): 20%
P4 (Low): 10%
```

Service Availability:
```
Availability % = ((Total Service Hours - Downtime Hours) ÷ Total Service Hours) × 100

Where:
Total Service Hours = Days in Period × Hours per Day
Downtime Hours = Sum of all service outage durations
```
