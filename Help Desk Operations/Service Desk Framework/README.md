# Service Desk Framework

## üìò Overview

The **Service Desk Framework** documentation provides comprehensive guidance on establishing, structuring, and optimizing the foundational elements of an enterprise help desk operation. This section addresses the organizational, procedural, and strategic components that form the backbone of an effective IT service desk.

## üèóÔ∏è Organizational Models

### Centralized Service Desk

A centralized model consolidates all support functions into a single organizational unit, typically operating from one or a few physical locations.

**Advantages:**
- Consistent service delivery and standardized processes
- Efficient resource utilization and staffing
- Simplified management and oversight
- Consolidated knowledge repository
- Clear career progression paths

**Disadvantages:**
- Potential distance from end-users
- Less familiarity with local business contexts
- Requires robust remote support capabilities

**Implementation Requirements:**
```
- Unified ticketing system with enterprise-wide visibility
- Virtual support technologies (remote control, screen sharing)
- Standardized knowledge management platform
- Centralized telecommunications infrastructure
- Unified metrics and reporting framework
```

### Distributed Service Desk

A distributed model places support resources across multiple locations, often aligned with business units or geographic regions.

**Advantages:**
- Local presence and familiarity with business units
- Face-to-face support capabilities
- Understanding of local requirements and constraints
- Faster physical intervention when required
- Cultural alignment with business units

**Disadvantages:**
- Inconsistent processes and service levels
- Duplication of resources and higher staffing requirements
- Knowledge silos and reduced collaboration
- Increased management complexity
- Potential for conflicting priorities

**Implementation Requirements:**
```
- Federated ticketing system with local flexibility
- Local knowledge repositories with synchronization
- Site-specific escalation procedures
- Localized SLAs aligned with business needs
- Coordination mechanisms between support teams
```

### Follow-the-Sun Support

A global support model where service desk functions transfer between geographic regions as business hours end in one location and begin in another.

**Advantages:**
- 24/7 support with minimal after-hours staffing
- Support staff working primarily during business hours
- Reduced fatigue associated with overnight shifts
- Natural language support across time zones

**Disadvantages:**
- Complex handover procedures
- Potential knowledge discontinuity
- Cultural and language challenges
- Higher coordination overhead
- Requires global standardization

**Implementation Requirements:**
```
- Shared ticketing system with global visibility
- Formalized shift handover procedures
- Real-time communication platforms
- Knowledge base available across all locations
- Cultural and language training
- Standardized categorization and resolution procedures
```

### Tiered Support Model

A structured approach that organizes support staff into levels based on expertise, with escalation paths between tiers.

**Tier 1 (Level 1 Support):**
- First point of contact for all incidents and service requests
- Focus on quick resolution of common issues
- Standard troubleshooting using established procedures
- High volume, relatively low complexity issues
- Typical resolution rate: 70-80% of all tickets

**Tier 2 (Level 2 Support):**
- Handles escalated issues beyond Tier 1 capabilities
- Deeper technical expertise in specific domains
- More complex troubleshooting and diagnosis
- Develops solutions for recurring issues
- Typical resolution rate: 15-20% of all tickets

**Tier 3 (Level 3 Support):**
- Highest level of technical expertise
- Specialized knowledge in specific systems or technologies
- Addresses complex, novel, or systemic issues
- Often involves vendor engagement or development resources
- Typical resolution rate: 5-10% of all tickets

**Swarming Model Alternative:**
An alternative to traditional tiering that brings together specialists as needed to collaborate on complex issues, eliminating handoffs.

**Swarming Implementation Requirements:**
```
- Collaboration platforms for real-time problem-solving
- Skills database to identify appropriate resources
- Flexible workload management
- Knowledge sharing during and after resolution
- Metrics focused on time to resolution rather than handoffs
```

## üìä Service Desk Staffing

### Staffing Calculations

Determine appropriate staffing levels using these formulas:

**Basic Staffing Formula:**
```
Required FTEs = (Monthly Ticket Volume √ó Average Handle Time) √∑ (Agent Productive Hours per Month)
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Monthly ticket volume: 2,500 tickets
- Average handle time: 18 minutes (0.3 hours)
- Agent productive hours per month: 140 hours (assuming 80% productivity)
- Required FTEs = (2,500 √ó 0.3) √∑ 140 = 5.36 FTEs

**Considerations for Staffing Adjustments:**
- Seasonal variation in ticket volume (add 10-15% capacity during peak periods)
- Complexity of supported systems (add 5-10% for highly complex environments)
- Service level requirements (higher SLAs require additional buffer capacity)
- Agent experience level (junior staff may require lower ticket expectations)
- Self-service adoption levels (effective self-service can reduce staffing needs)
- Channel mix (phone support requires more concurrent staffing than email)
