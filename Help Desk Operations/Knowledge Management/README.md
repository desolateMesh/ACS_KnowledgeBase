**How-To Article Example:**

```
Title: How to Set Up Multi-Factor Authentication for Microsoft 365

Overview:
This article provides step-by-step instructions for enabling and configuring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Microsoft 365 user accounts, enhancing security by requiring a secondary verification method beyond passwords.

Prerequisites:
- Microsoft 365 administrative access
- User email addresses for MFA enrollment
- Users have smartphones capable of running Microsoft Authenticator app

Procedure:
1. Access the Microsoft 365 Admin Center
   a. Navigate to admin.microsoft.com
   b. Sign in with administrative credentials

2. Navigate to MFA settings
   a. Select "Users" > "Active Users"
   b. Click "Multi-factor authentication" button

3. Enable MFA for users
   a. Select users to enable (individually or in bulk)
   b. Click "Enable" under quick steps
   c. Confirm the action when prompted

4. Configure MFA settings (optional)
   a. Click "service settings"
   b. Select allowed verification methods (app notification, phone call, SMS)
   c. Define trusted IP addresses if needed
   d. Save changes

5. User enrollment process
   a. User receives enrollment email
   b. User follows link and signs in
   c. User sets up verification method (preferably Microsoft Authenticator)
   d. User completes verification test

Expected Result:
Selected users will be required to complete MFA verification when signing into Microsoft 365 services from untrusted devices or locations.

Troubleshooting:
- If users don't receive enrollment email, check junk/spam folders
- For app installation issues, ensure device meets minimum OS requirements
- If verification fails repeatedly, try alternative verification method
- For persistent issues, temporary disable MFA for affected user
