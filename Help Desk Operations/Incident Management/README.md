# Incident Management

## 📘 Overview

The **Incident Management** documentation provides comprehensive guidance on the processes, procedures, and best practices for effectively handling IT service disruptions from initial detection through resolution. This framework ensures consistent, efficient handling of incidents to minimize business impact and restore normal service operation as quickly as possible.

## 🔄 Incident Lifecycle

### Definition and Scope

An **incident** is defined as:
> An unplanned interruption to an IT service or reduction in the quality of an IT service that affects users' ability to perform their normal business functions.

Incidents differ from problems and service requests:
- **Incident**: A service disruption requiring restoration
- **Problem**: The underlying cause of one or more incidents
- **Service Request**: A standard user request for information, access, or a change

### Incident Lifecycle Phases

1. **Detection and Identification**
   - Service disruption identified through monitoring, user reports, or automated alerts
   - Initial information gathered to confirm an incident has occurred

2. **Logging and Categorization**
   - Comprehensive incident record created in the ticketing system
   - Incident classified according to service, component, and symptom

3. **Prioritization**
   - Incident priority assigned based on impact and urgency
   - Service Level Agreement (SLA) timers initiated

4. **Initial Diagnosis**
   - First-level support conducts preliminary investigation
   - Known errors and knowledge base consulted
   - Basic troubleshooting procedures applied

5. **Escalation (if required)**
   - Functional escalation to higher support tiers
   - Hierarchical escalation for high-priority incidents
   - Vendor involvement when specialized support is required

6. **Investigation and Diagnosis**
   - Structured analysis of incident details
   - Root cause identification attempts
   - Solution determination or workaround identification

7. **Resolution and Recovery**
   - Implementation of fix or workaround
   - Confirmation that service has been restored
   - User verification of resolution

8. **Closure**
   - Incident record completion and documentation
   - User satisfaction assessment
   - Knowledge capture for future reference

## 📋 Incident Classification Framework

### Impact Levels

Impact measures the effect of an incident on business processes:

**Level 1 - Enterprise-Wide**
- Multiple business units or locations affected
- High-visibility services unavailable
- Executive leadership notified immediately
- Example: Email system outage affecting entire organization

**Level 2 - Department-Wide**
- Single department or business unit affected
- Core business function impaired
- Department leadership notified
- Example: Finance system unavailable during month-end closing

**Level 3 - Workgroup**
- Small group of users affected (5-25)
- Non-critical business functions impacted
- Example: Shared printer offline for a team

**Level 4 - Individual**
- Single user affected
- Minimal business impact
- Example: Individual user unable to access a specific application

### Urgency Levels

Urgency measures the necessary speed of resolution based on business needs:

**Level 1 - Critical**
- No workaround available
- Significant financial or regulatory impact if not resolved quickly
- Time-sensitive business function affected
- Example: Payment processing system down during transaction processing window

**Level 2 - High**
- Temporary workaround available but unstable or incomplete
- Important business deadline approaching
- Example: Reporting system issue one day before board meeting

**Level 3 - Medium**
- Stable workaround available
- Inconvenient but not preventing core work
- Example: Alternative access method available but less efficient

**Level 4 - Low**
- Minimal time sensitivity
- Issue causes minor inconvenience only
- Example: Cosmetic issue with non-critical application

### Priority Matrix

Priority is determined by combining impact and urgency:

| Impact↓ / Urgency→ | Level 1 (Critical) | Level 2 (High) | Level 3 (Medium) | Level 4 (Low) |
|--------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Level 1 (Enterprise)** | P1 - Critical | P1 - Critical | P2 - High | P3 - Medium |
| **Level 2 (Department)** | P1 - Critical | P2 - High | P3 - Medium | P4 - Low |
| **Level 3 (Workgroup)** | P2 - High | P3 - Medium | P4 - Low | P4 - Low |
| **Level 4 (Individual)** | P3 - Medium | P4 - Low | P4 - Low | P5 - Minimal |

### Service Level Agreement Targets

Each priority level has associated resolution targets:

| Priority Level | Response Time | Resolution Target | Update Frequency | After-Hours Support |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| P1 - Critical | Immediate | 2 hours | 30 minutes | 24/7 |
| P2 - High | 30 minutes | 4 hours | 1 hour | Business hours + on-call |
| P3 - Medium | 2 hours | 8 hours | 4 hours | Business hours |
| P4 - Low | 4 hours | 24 hours | Daily | Business hours |
| P5 - Minimal | 8 hours | 48 hours | When status changes | Business hours |
