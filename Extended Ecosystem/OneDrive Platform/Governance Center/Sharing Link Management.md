# Sharing Link Management for OneDrive Platform

## Overview

Effective management of sharing links in OneDrive environments is critical for balancing collaboration needs with security and compliance requirements. This document outlines comprehensive strategies for configuring, controlling, and monitoring sharing links to ensure secure content sharing while maintaining appropriate governance controls.

## Link Types and Characteristics

### 1. Anyone Links

- **Definition**: Links that allow access without authentication
- **Access Level**: Provides access to anyone who receives the link
- **Use Cases**: Public information sharing, marketing materials
- **Risk Level**: Highest risk, minimal tracking capabilities

### 2. External User Links

- **Definition**: Links that require authentication but allow non-organizational accounts
- **Access Level**: Allows specific external users access after authentication
- **Use Cases**: Vendor collaboration, client deliverables
- **Risk Level**: Medium risk, authenticated but outside organization

### 3. Internal Links

- **Definition**: Links that restrict access to organizational accounts only
- **Access Level**: Limited to users within the organization's directory
- **Use Cases**: Internal team collaboration, departmental sharing
- **Risk Level**: Lower risk, contained within organizational boundary

### 4. Specific People Links

- **Definition**: Links that restrict access to named individuals only
- **Access Level**: Limited to explicitly defined users (internal or external)
- **Use Cases**: Highly controlled sharing for sensitive content
- **Risk Level**: Lowest risk, explicit access control

## Permission Levels

### 1. View-Only Permissions

- Allows content viewing without editing capabilities
- Prevents download in browser when configured
- Supports information sharing with read restrictions
- Can be time-limited for temporary access

### 2. Edit Permissions

- Enables collaborative document editing
- Allows content modifications by recipients
- Supports workflow collaboration scenarios
- Can be restricted to browser-only editing

### 3. Review Permissions

- Allows comments and suggestions without direct edits
- Supports approval workflows and feedback cycles
- Provides controlled input mechanisms
- Maintains document integrity

### 4. Owner Permissions

- Provides full control including deletion and resharing
- Typically limited to internal users only
- Supports delegation of management responsibilities
- Highest risk if used with external sharing
