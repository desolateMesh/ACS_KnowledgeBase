## Planning Considerations

### Capacity Planning

Before implementing bulk enrollment, assess these factors:

- **Network capacity**: Evaluate bandwidth requirements for simultaneous enrollments
- **Infrastructure readiness**: Ensure cloud connectivity and proxy configurations
- **Service limits**: Review Intune service limits for enrollment throughput
- **Support resources**: Plan support staff allocation during enrollment waves
- **Timing**: Schedule enrollments during off-peak hours or phase across multiple days

### Pre-Enrollment Checklist

- Confirm licensing requirements are met
- Verify network connectivity to all required endpoints
- Test enrollment process with pilot devices before scaling
- Document enrollment procedures for support staff
- Create comprehensive user communication plan
- Prepare rollback procedures in case of issues

### Identity and Access Preparation

- Configure Azure AD Connect (if using hybrid identity)
- Prepare user accounts and group memberships
- Assign appropriate licenses to all users
- Configure authentication methods (MFA, FIDO2, etc.)
- Test user authentication flows before bulk enrollment

## Windows Autopilot Bulk Enrollment

### Hardware Hash Collection Methods

For registering devices in Autopilot at scale:

1. **OEM Direct Registration**:
   - Partner with OEMs that support Autopilot registration
   - Provide Commercial Windows SKU purchase information
   - Allow 1-2 business days for processing after delivery
   - Verify registration status in Intune portal

2. **CSV-Based Registration**:
   - For existing devices or non-participating OEMs
   - Use the Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo script to collect hashes:

```powershell
# Install the script from PowerShell Gallery
Install-Script -Name Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo

# Run on each device and append to single CSV
Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo -OutputFile C:\AutopilotHashes.csv -append

# For collecting hashes from running systems
Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo -Online -GroupTag "Finance-Dept"
```

3. **Partner Center API Integration**:
   - For Microsoft Partners managing multiple tenants
   - Use Partner Center API for programmatic device registration
   - Create automation workflows for consistent registration

### Autopilot Profile Configuration for Scale

Best practices for Autopilot profiles at scale:

1. **Create logical profile groupings** based on:
   - Department or business unit
   - Device type or role
   - Geographic location
   - Security requirements

2. **Profile settings optimization**:
   - Configure timeout settings appropriate for application payload size
   - Consider disabling "Block device use until all apps are installed" for better user experience
   - Use deployment profiles with appropriate OOBE customization
   - Enable BitLocker encryption during provisioning
   - Configure region and language settings for global deployments

3. **Group-based profile assignment**:
   - Create dynamic device groups based on OrderID or GroupTag
   - Assign profiles to groups rather than individual devices
   - Use naming conventions that clearly indicate profile purpose

### Autopilot Deployment Modes

Select the appropriate deployment mode based on needs:

1. **User-driven mode**:
   - End user completes setup with their credentials
   - Supports both Azure AD Join and Hybrid Azure AD Join
   - Best for distributed workforce with local admin needs

2. **Self-deploying mode**:
   - Zero-touch provisioning with no user interaction
   - Requires TPM 2.0 for device attestation
   - Ideal for kiosks, digital signage, and shared devices

3. **White glove deployment**:
   - Pre-provisioning by IT or partner before user receives device
   - Reduces user wait time by pre-loading apps and policies
   - Supports handoff to user-driven flow for final personalization

### Hardware Vendor Integration

Streamline Autopilot registration through vendor partnerships:

1. **Establish OEM partnerships** with:
   - Dell, HP, Lenovo, Microsoft, etc.
   - Authorized device resellers

2. **Vendor integration workflow**:
   - Provide Azure tenant ID to hardware vendor
   - Establish ordering process with Autopilot flags
   - Define GroupTag conventions for automatic group assignment
   - Validate test devices before bulk ordering
   - Create QA process for verifying registered devices

## Apple Automated Enrollment
