# FedRAMP Configuration

## Overview

This document provides guidance on configuring print infrastructure to meet Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) requirements. It outlines the security controls, implementation strategies, and compliance approaches for secure printing environments within the FedRAMP framework.

## FedRAMP Fundamentals

### What is FedRAMP?

The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a U.S. government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. FedRAMP was established to accelerate the adoption of secure cloud solutions by federal agencies while reducing the cost and time required for security assessments.

FedRAMP is built upon the security control framework defined in NIST Special Publication 800-53, but applies specific implementation requirements tailored to cloud computing environments.

### FedRAMP Impact Levels

FedRAMP defines three impact levels based on the potential impact of a security breach:

1. **Low Impact**: Loss could result in limited adverse effects on operations, assets, or individuals
2. **Moderate Impact**: Loss could result in serious adverse effects on operations, assets, or individuals
3. **High Impact**: Loss could result in severe or catastrophic adverse effects on operations, assets, or individuals

Most secure printing implementations fall under Moderate or High impact levels, depending on the sensitivity of the information being processed.

## Print Infrastructure in FedRAMP Context

Secure printing solutions under FedRAMP must address several key areas:

1. **Cloud-Based Print Management**: Security of cloud-based print management systems
2. **On-Premises Integration**: Secure integration with on-premises print infrastructure
3. **User Authentication**: FedRAMP-compliant authentication systems
4. **Data Protection**: Encryption and protection of print data
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing security assessment of print systems
