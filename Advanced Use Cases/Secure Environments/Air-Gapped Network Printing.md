# Air-Gapped Network Printing

## Overview

Air-gapped networks represent one of the highest security implementations for protecting sensitive data. These networks are physically isolated from unsecured networks, including the internet and other less-secure local networks. This document provides guidance on implementing printer solutions within air-gapped environments while maintaining the security integrity of these isolated networks.

## What is an Air-Gapped Network?

An air-gapped network is a security measure that involves keeping a computer or network physically isolated from unsecured networks, such as the public internet or insecure local area networks. The name "air gap" refers to the conceptual gap of air between the secured system and unsecured networks - there is literally no physical connection that would allow data to pass between them.

## Importance for Secure Printing Operations

Printing infrastructure presents particular security challenges due to:
- Modern printers contain full computing capabilities
- Printers often handle sensitive data during the printing process
- Networked printers can become entry points for lateral movement in a network

## Implementation Guidelines

### Hardware Requirements

- **Dedicated Printers**: Use printers dedicated exclusively to the air-gapped network
- **No Wireless Capabilities**: Ensure printers have no WiFi, Bluetooth, or other wireless capabilities, or that these features are permanently disabled
- **No External Media Ports**: Block or disable USB ports and other external media connections
- **Hardware Verification**: Verify printers for hardware tampering before introduction to the air-gapped environment

### Network Configuration

- **Physical Separation**: Maintain complete physical separation between air-gapped printing infrastructure and other networks
- **Dedicated Print Servers**: Deploy dedicated print servers within the air-gapped environment
- **No Dual-Network Interfaces**: Ensure no printer or print server has multiple network interfaces that could bridge networks
- **Static IP Addressing**: Use static IP addressing with no DHCP to maintain strict control of network assets

### Data Transfer Procedures

- **One-Way Transfer**: Implement strict one-way transfer protocols for moving print jobs to the air-gapped environment
- **Data Diodes**: Consider hardware data diodes for ensuring unidirectional data flow where appropriate
- **Physical Media Transfer**: Define secure procedures for transferring print jobs via physical media (including thorough malware scanning)
- **Write-Once Media**: When using physical media transfer, use write-once media where possible to prevent data exfiltration

### Maintenance Considerations

- **Dedicated Maintenance Devices**: Use dedicated maintenance laptops/devices that never leave the secure environment
- **Firmware Validation**: Validate all firmware updates through a formal security review process before installation
- **Clean Media Policy**: Establish protocols for introducing any maintenance media into the environment
- **Air-Gapped Updates**: Create procedures for securely transferring legitimate updates to the air-gapped environment

### Security Monitoring

- **Print Logging**: Implement comprehensive audit logging of all print activities
- **Physical Monitoring**: Consider camera monitoring of printer access in highly sensitive environments
- **Regular Inspections**: Conduct regular physical inspections of printers for tampering
- **Log Review**: Establish regular review procedures for print logs and physical access logs

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Software/Firmware Updates

**Solution**: Establish a secure, documented process for validating and transferring updates via clean media, including digital signature verification of update packages.

### Challenge: Print Job Transfer

**Solution**: Implement a rigorous, documented transfer process using write-once media or hardware data diodes to ensure unidirectional data flow into the air-gapped environment.

### Challenge: Maintenance Support

**Solution**: Create dedicated maintenance procedures that don't compromise the air gap, including maintaining dedicated maintenance tools that remain within the secure environment.

## Best Practices

1. **Document Everything**: Maintain detailed documentation of the air-gapped printing infrastructure including network diagrams, asset inventories, and security procedures
2. **Regular Security Assessments**: Conduct periodic security assessments of the air-gapped printing environment
3. **Strict Access Control**: Implement strict physical and logical access controls to the air-gapped environment
4. **Simplified Print Environment**: Keep the air-gapped print environment as simple as possible to reduce attack surface
5. **Print Job Authorization**: Implement print job authorization procedures for sensitive documents
6. **Train Personnel**: Provide specialized training for personnel authorized to manage air-gapped printing resources
