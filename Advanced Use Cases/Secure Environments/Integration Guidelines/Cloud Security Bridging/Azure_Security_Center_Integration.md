# Azure Security Center Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the approach for integrating secure print environments with Azure Security Center (now part of Microsoft Defender for Cloud) to establish comprehensive security monitoring, threat detection, and compliance management for print infrastructure in highly secure environments. This integration bridges the gap between traditional print environments and modern cloud security frameworks.

## Azure Security Integration Fundamentals

### Microsoft Defender for Cloud Capabilities

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides unified security management and advanced threat protection across hybrid cloud workloads. For secure print environments, this integration offers:

- **Continuous Security Assessment**: Ongoing evaluation of print infrastructure security posture
- **Security Recommendations**: Actionable guidance for securing print resources
- **Threat Protection**: Advanced detection of threats targeting print infrastructure
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Tracking compliance with various security standards
- **Unified Security Management**: Centralized visibility of print security across environments
