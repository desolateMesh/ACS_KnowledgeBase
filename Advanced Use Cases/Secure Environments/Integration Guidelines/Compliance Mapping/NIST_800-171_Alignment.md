# NIST 800-171 Alignment

## Overview

This document provides guidance on aligning secure printing environments with the requirements of NIST Special Publication 800-171, "Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations." The focus is on security controls and implementation practices specifically for print infrastructure that processes, stores, or transmits Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).

## NIST 800-171 Fundamentals

NIST 800-171 establishes security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI when the information resides in nonfederal systems and organizations. The standard contains 14 requirement families with a total of 110 security requirements. For organizations handling CUI in their print infrastructure, compliance with these requirements is mandatory when specified in federal contracts.

### CUI Definition and Scope

Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) is information created or possessed by the federal government, or by an entity on behalf of the federal government, that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and government-wide policies.

In the context of printing, CUI may include:
- Technical specifications and drawings
- Procurement sensitive information
- Privacy data covered under HIPAA or similar regulations
- Sensitive but unclassified defense information
- Export controlled information
- Any other information designated as CUI by the relevant federal agency

## Printing Infrastructure in NIST 800-171 Context

Printing infrastructure represents a significant risk area for CUI protection due to:
- Physical output of sensitive data into tangible form
- Network connectivity of modern printers
- Digital storage within printer memory and hard drives
- Multiple access vectors (network, physical, wireless)
- Complexity of modern multi-function devices
- Potential for data leakage through print logs and caches
