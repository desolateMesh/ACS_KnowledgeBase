# ISO 27001 Crosswalk

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive mapping between ISO 27001 security controls and secure printing requirements in high-security environments. This crosswalk serves as a reference for organizations implementing secure printing solutions while maintaining ISO 27001 compliance, particularly in sensitive or classified environments.

## ISO 27001 Framework Introduction

ISO/IEC 27001 is the international standard for information security management systems (ISMS). It provides a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information, ensuring it remains secure. The standard is organized into:

- **Main Clauses (4-10)**: Define the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an ISMS
- **Annex A Controls**: Specific security controls organized into domains/themes (93 controls in ISO 27001:2022, versus 114 controls in ISO 27001:2013)

The 2022 version of ISO 27001 reorganized controls into four themes:
1. Organizational Controls
2. People Controls
3. Physical Controls
4. Technological Controls

## Printing Security in ISO 27001 Context

Secure printing environments must address multiple aspects of the ISO 27001 standard. The following sections map specific printing security requirements to relevant ISO 27001 controls.
