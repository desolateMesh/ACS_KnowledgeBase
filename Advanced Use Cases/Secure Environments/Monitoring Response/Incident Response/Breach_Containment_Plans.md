# Breach Containment Plans

## Overview

This document provides a structured approach to containing security breaches in print environments. It outlines containment strategies, processes, and procedures to limit the impact of security incidents affecting print infrastructure. The focus is on rapid, effective containment actions that prevent further damage while preserving evidence for investigation and recovery.

## Breach Containment Fundamentals

### Definition and Purpose

Breach containment is the process of limiting and controlling the impact of an identified security incident to prevent further damage to information systems and data. The primary goals of breach containment in print environments are to:

1. **Limit Scope**: Prevent spread to other systems or devices
2. **Minimize Impact**: Reduce damage to operations and data
3. **Preserve Evidence**: Maintain forensic data for investigation
4. **Isolate Threats**: Separate malicious actors or components
5. **Prepare for Recovery**: Set the stage for system restoration

### Types of Print-Related Security Breaches

Print environments may experience various types of security breaches, each requiring specific containment approaches:

1. **Device Compromise**:
   - Firmware exploitation
   - Physical tampering
   - Unauthorized configuration changes
   - Malicious software installation

2. **Data Exfiltration**:
   - Unauthorized document printing
   - Print job interception
   - Document data theft
   - Print log extraction

3. **Network-Based Attacks**:
   - Man-in-the-middle attacks
   - Network protocol exploitation
   - Print traffic interception
   - Lateral movement via print infrastructure

4. **Unauthorized Access**:
   - Print authentication bypass
   - Privilege escalation
   - Administrative access abuse

## Containment Strategy Framework

### Containment Decision Factors

Key factors to consider when determining containment strategy:

1. **Breach Severity**:
