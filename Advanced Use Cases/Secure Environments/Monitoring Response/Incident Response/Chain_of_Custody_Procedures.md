# Chain of Custody Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the procedures and requirements for maintaining a proper chain of custody for evidence collected during security incidents involving print infrastructure. These procedures ensure that evidence remains admissible in legal proceedings, maintains its integrity throughout the investigation process, and supports accurate incident analysis and response.

## Chain of Custody Fundamentals

### Definition and Purpose

Chain of custody refers to the chronological documentation and controlled handling of evidence from the moment of collection through investigation, analysis, and final disposition. In print security contexts, it serves to:

1. **Ensure Evidence Integrity**: Prevent tampering, alteration, or contamination
2. **Establish Authenticity**: Prove evidence is genuine and unaltered
3. **Enable Admissibility**: Meet legal requirements for evidence in proceedings
4. **Support Attribution**: Link evidence to specific individuals or systems
5. **Maintain Reliability**: Ensure evidence can be relied upon for investigation and remediation

### Legal and Compliance Requirements

Chain of custody procedures must satisfy:

1. **Legal Standards**: Evidence handling requirements set by applicable laws
2. **Industry Regulations**: Sector-specific requirements (e.g., HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
