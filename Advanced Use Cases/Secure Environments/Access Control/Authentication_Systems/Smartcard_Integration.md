  - Key recovery procedures
  - Certificate renewal processes

- **Private Key Protection**
  - Hardware-based key storage
  - PIN protection requirements
  - Anti-hammering (lockout after failed attempts)
  - Tamper-evident physical cards

### Threat Mitigations

- **Lost/Stolen Card Procedures**
  - Immediate revocation process
  - Emergency access procedures
  - Temporary credentials issuance
