# SCIF-Compliant Printer Setup

## Overview

A Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) represents one of the most secure environments designed for handling classified information. This document outlines the requirements, procedures, and best practices for implementing printing solutions within SCIF environments while maintaining compliance with relevant security standards.

## SCIF Environment Background

A SCIF is a specially constructed secure room or facility designed to prevent electronic surveillance and protect classified information. SCIFs are built and maintained to strict specifications outlined in Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 705 and related technical specifications. All equipment, including printers, that operates within a SCIF must adhere to specific security requirements.

## Printer Security Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- **TEMPEST Certification**: Printers must have appropriate TEMPEST certification corresponding to the classification level of the SCIF (typically Level I or Level II)
- **No Wireless Capabilities**: Printers must not have WiFi, Bluetooth, or other wireless communication capabilities, or these features must be permanently disabled
- **No External Storage**: Printers should not contain features for external storage (SD card slots, USB ports) or these must be physically disabled
- **No Acoustic Vulnerabilities**: Printers must not be susceptible to acoustic side-channel attacks
- **Electromagnetic Shielding**: Printers must have appropriate shielding to prevent electromagnetic emanations that could be intercepted
- **Hard Drive Security**: If the printer contains a hard drive, it must be encrypted and securable

### Placement and Physical Security

- **Within SCIF Boundaries**: Printers must be located entirely within the SCIF boundaries
- **Physical Access Controls**: Printers should be positioned to allow observation and control of physical access
- **No Line of Sight**: Printers should not be visible from windows or other observation points
- **Structural Isolation**: Consider structural isolation from walls shared with non-SCIF areas
- **RF Shielding**: Ensure proper radio frequency (RF) shielding commensurate with the SCIF's technical specifications

### Network Configuration

- **Air-Gapped Network**: Printers must operate on a completely air-gapped network or one that meets SCIF network requirements
- **No External Connections**: No connections to external networks, including the internet
- **Hardwired Only**: Only hardwired network connections are permitted (no wireless)
- **Network Monitoring**: All printer network traffic must be monitored and logged
- **Static IP Configuration**: Use static IP addressing with stringent network access controls

## Implementation Process

### Pre-Installation

1. **Security Clearance Verification**: Ensure all personnel involved in installation have appropriate security clearances
2. **Equipment Verification**: Verify printer equipment meets all TEMPEST and security requirements
3. **Installation Plan**: Develop a detailed installation plan that maintains SCIF integrity throughout the process
4. **Security Review**: Have the installation plan reviewed by appropriate security personnel
5. **Escort Arrangements**: Arrange for cleared escorts for any uncleared personnel who must enter the SCIF

### Installation

1. **SCIF Access Protocol**: Follow all SCIF access protocols for bringing equipment into the facility
2. **Equipment Inspection**: Conduct thorough inspection of all equipment before introduction to the SCIF
3. **Tamper-Evident Seals**: Apply tamper-evident seals to printer components after installation
4. **Network Isolation**: Verify complete network isolation during and after installation
5. **Physical Security**: Ensure physical security measures are in place (locks, access controls)

### Post-Installation

1. **Security Testing**: Perform comprehensive security testing of the printer installation
2. **TEMPEST Verification**: Conduct TEMPEST verification testing as required
3. **Documentation**: Complete all required documentation for SCIF equipment
4. **User Training**: Provide specific training for authorized users
5. **Maintenance Procedures**: Document maintenance procedures that maintain SCIF integrity

## Operational Security Procedures

### Day-to-Day Operations

- **Access Control**: Implement strict access control for print operations
- **Classified Material Handling**: Follow all classified material handling protocols for printed documents
- **Job Logging**: Maintain comprehensive logs of all print jobs
- **Regular Inspections**: Conduct regular inspections of printer hardware for tampering
- **Clear Print Queue**: Ensure print queues are cleared after each use

### Maintenance Procedures

- **Cleared Technicians**: Only appropriately cleared technicians should perform maintenance
- **Maintenance Supervision**: Maintenance activities should be supervised by security personnel
- **Parts Replacement Protocol**: Establish strict protocols for parts replacement
- **Sanitization Procedures**: Implement proper sanitization procedures for any components removed from the SCIF
- **Maintenance Documentation**: Maintain detailed maintenance logs

### Decommissioning

- **Media Sanitization**: Perform appropriate sanitization of any storage media
- **Destruction Verification**: Verify destruction of sensitive components
- **Documentation**: Complete all decommissioning documentation
- **Physical Removal**: Follow SCIF protocols for physical removal of equipment

## Compliance and Certification

### Relevant Standards

- Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 705
- NIST Special Publication 800-53
- Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Instructions
- TEMPEST standards (NSTISSAM TEMPEST/1-92 or subsequent)
- Agency-specific SCIF requirements

### Certification Process

- **Initial Certification**: Document the process for initial certification of the printer installation
- **Periodic Recertification**: Outline requirements for periodic recertification
- **Change Management**: Establish procedures for managing and recertifying after changes

## Incident Response

- **Compromise Procedures**: Document procedures for responding to potential compromise
- **Reporting Chain**: Establish clear reporting chains for security incidents
- **Containment Actions**: Define immediate containment actions for various types of incidents
- **Investigation Process**: Outline the process for investigating security incidents
- **Recovery Procedures**: Document recovery procedures following an incident
