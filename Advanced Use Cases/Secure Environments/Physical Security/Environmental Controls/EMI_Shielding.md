# EMI Shielding

## Overview

Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) shielding is a critical security component in protected environments where sensitive information is processed, including by printing equipment. This document provides comprehensive guidance on implementing EMI shielding for printer infrastructure in secure environments, focusing on practical techniques, material selection, and implementation strategies.

## EMI Fundamentals

### Understanding EMI

Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) refers to the disruption of electronic equipment operation due to electromagnetic radiation emitted by another electronic device, or the unintended emission of electromagnetic radiation that could:

1. **Compromise Data**: Emit signals that could be intercepted to reconstruct sensitive information
2. **Disrupt Operations**: Interfere with the proper functioning of equipment
3. **Create Vulnerabilities**: Create security vulnerabilities through side-channel attacks

In secure environments, EMI shielding serves both to contain emissions from sensitive equipment (including printers) and to protect that equipment from external interference.

### EMI in Printing Equipment

Modern printers present specific EMI challenges:

- **Multiple Processing Components**: CPUs, memory, and interface circuits that generate emissions
- **Motor Systems**: Stepper motors and drive systems that create electromagnetic noise
- **Power Supplies**: Switching power supplies that can generate significant EMI
- **Data Processing**: Data processing activities that may create information-bearing emissions
- **Communications Interfaces**: Network and communication interfaces that can act as unintended antennas
