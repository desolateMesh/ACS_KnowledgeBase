# Faraday Cage Installation

## Overview

Faraday cages are essential components in secure environments to contain electromagnetic emanations from electronic equipment, including printers, and to prevent electromagnetic eavesdropping from outside sources. This document provides guidelines for implementing Faraday cage solutions specifically for printer environments in high-security facilities such as SCIFs (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities).

## Faraday Cage Fundamentals

### Definition and Purpose

A Faraday cage is an enclosure formed by conductive material or a mesh of conductive material that blocks electromagnetic fields. In secure facilities, Faraday cages serve two primary purposes:

1. **Signal Containment**: Preventing electromagnetic signals from sensitive equipment (including printers) from escaping the secure environment
2. **Signal Exclusion**: Blocking external electromagnetic signals from entering the secure environment

Faraday cages are a critical component of TEMPEST countermeasures and are often required for SCIF compliance.
