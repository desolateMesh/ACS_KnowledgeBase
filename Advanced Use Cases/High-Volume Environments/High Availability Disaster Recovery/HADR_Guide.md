## Key HADR Concepts

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

The maximum acceptable time required to restore service after a failure incident. For high-volume environments, this may range from:

- **Near-zero RTO**: < 1 minute (typically for mission-critical systems)
- **Low RTO**: 1-15 minutes
- **Medium RTO**: 15-60 minutes
- **High RTO**: > 1 hour (for non-critical workloads)

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

The maximum acceptable data loss measured in time. Options include:

- **Near-zero RPO**: < 5 seconds (requires synchronous replication)
- **Low RPO**: 5 seconds - 5 minutes
- **Medium RPO**: 5 minutes - 1 hour
- **High RPO**: > 1 hour

### Availability SLAs

Different Azure services provide varying levels of availability SLAs:

| Service Level | Expected Uptime | Downtime Per Year |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 99.9%         | "Three nines"   | 8.76 hours        |
| 99.95%        | "Three and a half nines" | 4.38 hours |
| 99.99%        | "Four nines"    | 52.56 minutes     |
| 99.999%       | "Five nines"    | 5.26 minutes      |

### Failure Domains

Understanding potential failure scopes:

- **Component-level failures**: Individual VMs, disks, network adapters
- **Rack-level failures**: Power or networking equipment
- **Datacenter-level failures**: Natural disasters, power outages
- **Regional failures**: Large-scale outages affecting an entire Azure region
- **Service-level failures**: Issues affecting specific Azure services

## Architecture Patterns

### Active-Passive

- Primary site actively handles requests
- Secondary site on standby, not actively serving requests
- Lower cost but typically higher RTO
- Examples: Azure Site Recovery (ASR) with cold or warm standby configurations

**Implementation considerations:**
```
- Manual or automated failover mechanisms
- Regular testing required to ensure standby readiness
- May require DNS changes during failover
- Data synchronization requirements based on RPO
```

### Active-Active

- Multiple sites actively handling requests simultaneously
- Load balancing across sites
- Lower RTO but higher complexity and cost
- Examples: Traffic Manager + multiple region deployments

**Implementation considerations:**
```
- Data synchronization challenges
- Application must be designed for distributed operation
- Potential for data conflicts during concurrent operations
- Higher operational complexity
```

### Hybrid Patterns

Strategic mixing of active-passive and active-active components based on criticality:

- **Critical components**: Active-active deployment across regions
- **Important but less critical**: Active-passive with warm standby
- **Non-critical components**: Active-passive with cold standby

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Tiered Resilience Model

Implementing varied resilience levels based on workload criticality:

1. **Platinum Tier**:
   - Active-active multi-region deployment
   - Synchronous data replication
   - Automated failover capability
   - Comprehensive monitoring

2. **Gold Tier**:
   - Active-passive with warm standby
   - Near-synchronous or asynchronous replication
   - Semi-automated failover capability
   - Core monitoring coverage

3. **Silver Tier**:
   - Active-passive with cold standby
   - Scheduled data replication or backups
   - Manual recovery procedures
   - Basic monitoring

Cost comparison example:
```
Sample 3-tier web application (monthly):

Platinum Tier: $25,000-35,000
- Multi-region active-active
- Premium SKUs with zone redundancy
- RA-GZRS storage
- 24/7 monitoring

Gold Tier: $15,000-20,000
- Warm standby in secondary region

2. **Storage Optimization**:
   - Tiered storage approach based on data criticality
   - Lifecycle management policies
   - Compression and deduplication where applicable

3. **Networking Cost Control**:
   - Traffic Manager instead of active-active for suitable workloads
   - ExpressRoute with appropriate circuit sizing
   - Cross-region traffic optimization

4. **Operational Efficiency**:
   - Automation to reduce manual effort
   - Self-healing capabilities to minimize intervention
   - Streamlined testing procedures

Optimization checklist:
```
[] Review and adjust backup retention periods based on compliance requirements
[] Implement auto-scaling for secondary region resources during non-test periods
[] Utilize reserved instances for persistent components
[] Configure storage lifecycle management
[] Optimize networking with Virtual WAN or ExpressRoute where appropriate
[] Automate routine DR testing to reduce operational costs
[] Implement resource locks to prevent accidental deletion
```
