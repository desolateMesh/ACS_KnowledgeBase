# Hub and Spoke Network Topologies in Azure

## Overview

Hub and Spoke network topology is a fundamental architectural pattern in Azure that enables organizations to efficiently manage network traffic, security, and connectivity in complex enterprise environments. This design centralizes common network services in a "hub" Virtual Network (VNet), which connects to multiple "spoke" VNets containing application workloads.

## When to Use Hub and Spoke

Hub and Spoke topologies are ideal for organizations that need:

- Centralized security and network management
- Separation of concerns between networking and application teams
- Cost optimization by centralizing shared services
- Consistent connectivity to on-premises resources
- Scalable architecture that can grow with the organization

## Key Benefits

1. **Centralized Security** - Security services and monitoring in a single location
2. **Cost Efficiency** - Reduced need for redundant services in each workload VNet
3. **Simplified Management** - Easier to implement consistent policies and governance
4. **Scalability** - Add new spokes without redesigning the entire network
5. **Connectivity** - Consistent access to on-premises resources and the internet
