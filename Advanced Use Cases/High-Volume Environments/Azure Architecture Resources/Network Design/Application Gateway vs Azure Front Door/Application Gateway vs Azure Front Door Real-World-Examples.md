## Implementation Insights and Best Practices

From these case studies, several common best practices emerge:

1. **Layer your defenses**: Using Front Door and Application Gateway together provides defense in depth.

2. **Regional optimization**: Deploy Application Gateway instances in each region to optimize local traffic management.

3. **Custom security rules**: Create WAF rules tailored to your specific industry threats.

4. **Health probe design**: Design comprehensive health probes that validate application functionality, not just connectivity.

5. **Logging and monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging across all layers for troubleshooting and security auditing.

6. **Capacity planning**: Size your infrastructure based on peak load with appropriate auto-scaling settings.

7. **Global-to-local architecture**: Design architectures that flow from global services (Front Door) down to regional services (Application Gateway) and finally to local services (backends).

8. **Zero-trust approach**: Implement Private Link connections where possible, especially for sensitive data.

9. **Fallback strategies**: Design systems to gracefully degrade during partial outages or attacks.

10. **Cost optimization**: Use caching strategies and right-sized deployments to optimize costs while maintaining performance.
