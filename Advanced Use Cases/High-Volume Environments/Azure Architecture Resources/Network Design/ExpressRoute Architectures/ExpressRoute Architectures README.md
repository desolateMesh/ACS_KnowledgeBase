# Azure ExpressRoute Architectures

## Overview
This section provides comprehensive guidance on designing, implementing, and troubleshooting Azure ExpressRoute architectures for high-volume enterprise environments. ExpressRoute provides private, dedicated connectivity between on-premises networks and Azure, enabling hybrid cloud scenarios with higher reliability, faster speeds, and lower latencies than typical internet connections.

## Contents
This documentation collection covers:

- **[Design Patterns](./design-patterns.md)**: Common architecture patterns and best practices for ExpressRoute deployments
- **[Implementation Guide](./implementation-guide.md)**: Step-by-step instructions for setting up and configuring ExpressRoute circuits
- **[Real-World Examples](./real-world-examples.md)**: Case studies and reference implementations from actual deployments
- **[Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md)**: Common issues, diagnostics, and remediation steps

## Key Concepts
- **ExpressRoute Circuit**: The fundamental building block that establishes connectivity between on-premises infrastructure and Microsoft cloud services
- **Peering Types**: Private, Microsoft, and (legacy) public peerings for different connectivity scenarios
- **Redundancy Models**: Various approaches to ensure high availability with ExpressRoute
- **Global Reach**: Connecting geographically distributed sites through ExpressRoute
