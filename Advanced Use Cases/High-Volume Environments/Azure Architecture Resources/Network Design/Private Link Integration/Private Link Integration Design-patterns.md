# Private Link Integration: Design Patterns

## Introduction

This document covers design patterns for implementing Azure Private Link in high-volume environments. Private Link enables you to securely access Azure PaaS services over a private endpoint in your virtual network, minimizing exposure to the public internet and helping meet security and compliance requirements.

## Key Design Patterns

### Pattern 1: Hub and Spoke with Centralized Private Endpoints

#### Description
In this pattern, private endpoints are deployed in a central hub virtual network, with multiple spoke networks accessing the endpoints through VNet peering.

#### Architecture Components
- Hub Virtual Network with dedicated Private Endpoint subnet
- Spoke Virtual Networks peered to the Hub
- Private DNS Zones for name resolution
- Network Security Groups to control traffic

#### Advantages
- Centralized management of private endpoints
- Reduced number of private endpoints required
- Simplified DNS configuration
- Cost-effective deployment model

#### Considerations
- Potential single point of failure if not properly designed
- Traffic between spokes must traverse the hub
- Requires careful capacity planning for the hub network
- May require more complex DNS forwarding configuration

│   └── PE for Azure Key Vault
├── DNS Subnet
│   └── DNS Forwarders
└── Gateway Subnet
    └── VPN/ExpressRoute Gateway

### Pattern 2: Distributed Private Endpoints

#### Description
In this pattern, private endpoints are deployed directly in each spoke network where the services are consumed.

#### Architecture Components
- Private Endpoints in each spoke VNet
- Shared Private DNS Zones (potentially linked to multiple VNets)
- Local NSGs in each spoke for traffic control

#### Advantages
- Direct connectivity to services
- Lower latency (no transit through hub)
- Better isolation between spokes
- Independent scaling in each spoke

#### Considerations
- More private endpoints to manage
- Higher cost due to additional private endpoints
- More complex DNS configuration across multiple VNets
- Potential for endpoint sprawl

└── Private Endpoint Subnet
    ├── PE for Azure SQL
    └── PE for Azure Storage

Spoke VNet 2
├── Application Subnet
│   └── Application VMs/Services
└── Private Endpoint Subnet
    ├── PE for Azure Key Vault
    └── PE for Azure SQL

Hub VNet
└── Shared Services
    └── DNS Management
```

### Pattern 3: Service Provider Pattern

#### Description
This pattern is used when you're exposing your own services through Private Link and need to make them available to consumers.

#### Architecture Components
- Service Provider Virtual Network
- Private Link Service
- Standard Load Balancer (internal)
- Consumer Virtual Networks with Private Endpoints

#### Advantages
- Secure service exposure to selected consumers
- No public internet exposure
- Granular access control to service resources
- Support for cross-tenant scenarios

#### Considerations
- Requires Standard SKU Load Balancer
- NAT configuration requirements
- Approval workflow for private endpoint connections
- Proper DNS configuration needed on consumer side

├── Application Subnet
│   └── Backend Services
└── Frontend Subnet
    ├── Internal Load Balancer
    └── Private Link Service

Consumer VNet 1                 Consumer VNet 2
├── Application Subnet          ├── Application Subnet
└── Private Endpoint Subnet     └── Private Endpoint Subnet
    └── PE to Service               └── PE to Service
```

## DNS Considerations

Private Link integration relies heavily on proper DNS configuration. Consider the following approaches:

### Centralized Private DNS Zones
- Create Private DNS Zones in a central subscription/resource group
- Link zones to all VNets that need to resolve private endpoints
- Automate zone management for scalability

### Hybrid DNS Resolution
- On-premises DNS servers forwarding to Azure DNS
- Azure DNS private resolver for complex hybrid scenarios
- Conditional forwarders for specific Azure service domains

### Automation Best Practices
- Use Infrastructure as Code for consistent deployment
- Implement Azure Policy for governance
- Leverage naming conventions for easy identification

## Security Considerations

### Network Security Groups
- Apply NSGs to private endpoint subnets
- Allow only necessary traffic to private endpoints
- Monitor and audit NSG rules regularly

### Private Endpoint Network Policies
- Understand implications of enabling/disabling network policies
- Plan IP address allocation to accommodate policies
- Consider future growth when designing subnets

### Monitoring
- Configure diagnostic logs for private endpoints
- Set up alerts for connection failures
- Implement Azure Monitor for comprehensive visibility
