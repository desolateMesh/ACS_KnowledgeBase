# Design Patterns for Azure Reservations and Savings Plans

This document outlines proven design patterns and strategies for implementing Azure Reservations and Savings Plans to maximize cost savings while maintaining operational flexibility.

## Hybrid Approach Pattern

### Overview
This pattern combines both Azure Reservations and Savings Plans to get the best of both worlds: maximum discount rates and flexibility.

### Implementation
1. **Base Load Coverage**: Use Azure Reservations for your stable, predictable workloads that maintain consistent resource usage.
2. **Variable Coverage**: Use Azure Savings Plans for dynamic workloads that may change over time or across regions.

### Benefits
- Maximizes discount percentages for predictable workloads
- Maintains flexibility for changing resource needs
- Optimizes overall cost across your entire Azure environment

### Example Scenario
An enterprise with 50 production VMs that run consistently can purchase Azure Reservations for these instances, while using Azure Savings Plans to cover development/test environments that frequently change in size and resource requirements.

## Tiered Commitment Pattern

### Overview
This pattern involves implementing commitments in phases, starting conservatively and gradually increasing as you validate actual usage and savings.

### Implementation
1. **Initial Commitment**: Start with a small percentage (30-50%) of your total eligible resources
2. **Monitoring Phase**: Track utilization rates for 30-60 days
3. **Expansion Phase**: Incrementally increase commitment levels based on validated usage patterns
4. **Optimization Phase**: Fine-tune the balance between Reservations and Savings Plans

### Benefits
- Reduces risk of over-commitment
- Allows for learning and adjustment
- Builds confidence in the ROI of commitment-based pricing

### Example Scenario
A company new to Azure commitments might start by covering 40% of its compute resources with a combination of Reservations and Savings Plans, monitor for two months, then increase coverage to 60%, and eventually to 80% after gaining confidence in their usage patterns.

## Regional Flexibility Pattern

### Overview
This pattern leverages the geographic flexibility of Azure Savings Plans for globally distributed applications.

### Implementation
1. **Identify Global Workloads**: Map out workloads that operate across multiple regions
2. **Calculate Consistent Hourly Usage**: Determine the minimum consistent hourly spend across all regions
3. **Implement Savings Plan**: Purchase a Savings Plan that covers this baseline global usage
4. **Monitor Regional Distribution**: Track how the benefits apply across different regions

### Benefits
- Simplifies cost management for global applications
- Takes advantage of "follow-the-sun" workload models
- Automatically optimizes discount application across regions

### Example Scenario
A company operating a global service with components in North America, Europe, and Asia can utilize a single Savings Plan that automatically applies to resources regardless of which region is experiencing peak usage at any given time.

## Resource Evolution Pattern

### Overview
This pattern addresses organizations that regularly upgrade or change their VM types to leverage new Azure capabilities.

### Implementation
1. **Identify Evolutionary Resources**: Determine which resources frequently change in size or family
2. **Apply Savings Plans**: Use Azure Savings Plans for these resources to maintain discount levels despite changes
3. **Reserve Stable Resources**: Use Azure Reservations only for resources that maintain consistent configurations
4. **Review Quarterly**: Reassess the mix quarterly to ensure optimal savings

### Benefits
- Maintains discounts despite technology upgrades
- Supports innovation without financial penalty
- Provides flexibility to adopt new Azure services as they become available

### Example Scenario
A technology company that regularly tests new Azure VM sizes and capabilities for their applications can use Savings Plans to maintain discounts while frequently changing resource types.

## Organizational Scoping Pattern

### Overview
This pattern strategically assigns reservations and savings plans to different organizational levels to optimize benefit distribution.

### Implementation
1. **Enterprise-level Sharing**: Apply broad Savings Plans at the enrollment level for maximum flexibility
2. **Department-level Allocation**: Assign specific Reservations to departments with stable, predictable workloads
3. **Project-level Assignment**: For special projects with dedicated resources, assign Reservations directly to those subscriptions
4. **Hybrid Scoping**: Combine different scoping levels based on your organizational structure

### Benefits
- Aligns cost optimization with organizational structure
- Enables departmental accountability for resource usage
- Maximizes discount utilization across the organization

### Example Scenario
An organization might apply a large Savings Plan at the enterprise level to cover general compute usage across all departments, while assigning specific Reservations to the Finance department for their stable database servers that run consistently all year.

## Seasonal Workload Pattern

### Overview
This pattern addresses businesses with predictable seasonal fluctuations in resource usage.

### Implementation
1. **Baseline Coverage**: Use Azure Reservations for the minimum baseline capacity used year-round
2. **Flexible Supplement**: Apply Savings Plans to cover the predictable portion of seasonal variations
3. **On-demand Usage**: Leave truly unpredictable spikes to on-demand pricing
4. **Annual Reassessment**: Review and adjust the commitment mix yearly based on evolving business patterns

### Benefits
- Optimizes costs for businesses with seasonal patterns
- Balances maximum discounts for baseline with flexibility for variations
- Avoids over-commitment during low-usage periods

### Example Scenario
A retail company might use Reservations for their consistent year-round infrastructure needs, while applying Savings Plans to cover the additional predictable capacity needed during the holiday shopping season.

## Best Practices for All Patterns

1. **Regular Review**: Schedule quarterly reviews of your commitment utilization and effectiveness
2. **Tagging Strategy**: Implement comprehensive resource tagging to track which resources are covered by which commitments
3. **Automated Monitoring**: Set up alerts for under-utilization or significant changes in usage patterns
4. **Centralized Oversight**: Establish a cloud center of excellence or FinOps team to manage commitments
5. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of your commitment strategy and decision-making rationale
