# Multi-Stage Azure Pipelines

## Overview

Multi-Stage Azure Pipelines provide a comprehensive framework for implementing continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows in complex, high-volume Azure environments. This section contains architecture guidance, implementation patterns, real-world examples, and troubleshooting information to help you design and implement robust pipeline solutions.

## Contents

- [Design Patterns](design-patterns.md) - Architecture patterns and best practices for structuring multi-stage pipelines
- [Implementation Guide](implementation-guide.md) - Detailed implementation steps and configuration instructions
- [Real-World Examples](real-world-examples.md) - Production-tested scenarios and reference implementations
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) - Common issues, solutions, and debugging techniques

## Key Benefits

- **Environment Isolation** - Separate stages for development, testing, staging, and production environments
- **Approval Gates** - Configurable approvals and quality checks between deployment stages
- **Deployment Strategies** - Support for blue/green, canary, and rolling deployment methodologies
- **Pipeline as Code** - YAML-based configuration for version-controlled pipeline definitions
- **Reusability** - Templates and parameterization for creating standardized pipeline components
- **Traceability** - End-to-end visibility from code commit to production deployment
- **Compliance** - Audit trails and controlled progression through environments

## Getting Started

For organizations new to multi-stage pipelines, we recommend the following approach:

1. Review the [Design Patterns](design-patterns.md) to understand architectural options
2. Follow the [Implementation Guide](implementation-guide.md) to set up your first pipeline
3. Reference [Real-World Examples](real-world-examples.md) for industry-specific implementations
4. Bookmark the [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) guide for resolving common issues

## Prerequisites

- Azure DevOps Services or Azure DevOps Server 2019+
- Azure Subscription
- Azure Service Connection with appropriate permissions
- Basic understanding of YAML syntax
- Access to Azure Pipeline agents (Microsoft-hosted or self-hosted)
