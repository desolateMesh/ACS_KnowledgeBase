# Design Patterns for Multi-Stage Azure Pipelines

## Overview

Multi-stage pipelines in Azure DevOps provide a structured approach to implementing continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows. This document outlines established design patterns to help you architect efficient, maintainable, and scalable pipeline configurations for high-volume environments.

## Core Design Patterns

### 1. Environment Promotion Pattern

This pattern implements a progressive deployment strategy across environments with increasing levels of validation.

#### Implementation

```yaml
stages:
- stage: Build
  jobs:
  - job: Compile
    steps:
    - script: echo Building application
    - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
      inputs:
        command: 'build'
        projects: '**/*.csproj'
    - task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
      inputs:
        targetPath: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
        artifactName: 'drop'

- stage: Dev
  dependsOn: Build
  jobs:
  - deployment: DevDeploy
    environment: Development
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
            inputs:
              artifactName: 'drop'
          - script: echo Deploying to Dev

- stage: Test
  dependsOn: Dev
  jobs:
  - deployment: TestDeploy
    environment: Test
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
            inputs:
              artifactName: 'drop'
          - script: echo Deploying to Test

- stage: Production
  dependsOn: Test
  jobs:
  - deployment: ProdDeploy
    environment: Production
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
            inputs:
              artifactName: 'drop'
          - script: echo Deploying to Production
```

#### Benefits

* Ensures consistent artifact promotion  
* Provides clear visibility into deployment status  
* Enables environment-specific approvals and checks

### 2. Parallel Validation Pattern

This pattern executes multiple validation jobs concurrently to reduce pipeline execution time.

#### Implementation

```yaml
stages:
- stage: Build
  jobs:
  - job: BuildApp
    steps:
    - script: echo Building application
    - task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
      inputs:
        targetPath: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
        artifactName: 'drop'

- stage: Validate
  dependsOn: Build
  jobs:
  - job: SecurityScan
    steps:
    - task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
      inputs:
        artifactName: 'drop'
    - script: echo Running security scan

  - job: UnitTests
    steps:
    - task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
      inputs:
        artifactName: 'drop'
    - script: echo Running unit tests

  - job: IntegrationTests
    steps:
    - task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
      inputs:
        artifactName: 'drop'
    - script: echo Running integration tests

- stage: Deploy
  dependsOn: Validate
  jobs:
  - deployment: Production
    environment: Production
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
            inputs:
              artifactName: 'drop'
          - script: echo Deploying to production
```

#### Benefits

* Reduces overall pipeline execution time  
* Provides early feedback on different validation aspects  
* Enables fail-fast approach to detect issues

## Best Practices

* **Artifact Immutability**: Build once, deploy many times across environments  
* **Environment Variables**: Use variable groups and Azure Key Vault for configuration  
* **Quality Gates**: Implement automated quality checks between stages  
* **Approval Workflows**: Require approvals for sensitive environments  
* **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrate monitoring setup in deployment stages  
* **Timeouts and Retry Logic**: Set appropriate policies  
* **Dependency Management**: Define clear stage dependencies and conditions  
* **Resource Cleanup**: Include cleanup for temporary resources  

---

## Additional Considerations for High-Volume Environments

* **Pipeline Caching**: Use build artifact caching to speed up performance  
* **Self-Hosted Agents**: Use dedicated agent pools  
* **Parallel Execution**: Enable parallel job execution  
* **Resource Throttling**: Prevent overwhelming target systems with release gates  
* **Telemetry**: Monitor pipeline metrics for insights

## Conclusion

Effective multi-stage pipeline designs balance automation, security, and operational efficiency. By applying these patterns appropriately, you can create robust CI/CD workflows that scale with your organization's needs while maintaining reliability and governance requirements.
