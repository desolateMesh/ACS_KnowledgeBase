# Deploying ACR and AKS at Scale

This section contains architecture guidance, implementation patterns, real-world examples, and troubleshooting advice for deploying Azure Container Registry (ACR) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) in high-volume, enterprise-grade environments.

## Contents

-   **[design-patterns.md](design-patterns.md)**: Outlines key architectural considerations, best practices, and design patterns for achieving scalability, high availability, security, and operational efficiency with ACR and AKS.
-   **[implementation-guide.md](implementation-guide.md)**: Provides a step-by-step guide with commands and configurations for implementing the scalable design patterns discussed, intended for practical deployment using IaC or Azure CLI.
-   **[real-world-examples.md](real-world-examples.md)**: Illustrates the application of these design patterns through concrete examples, such as high-availability regional platforms, multi-region global applications, and cost-optimized batch processing systems.
-   **[troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md)**: Offers a structured approach and detailed steps for diagnosing and resolving common issues encountered in complex ACR and AKS deployments, covering areas like image pulling, node health, networking, scaling, and security.
