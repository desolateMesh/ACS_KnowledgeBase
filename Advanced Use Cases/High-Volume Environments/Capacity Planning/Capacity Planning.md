## Introduction
Capacity planning in high-volume environments involves systematic determination of resources required to meet current and future demands. This process directly affects performance, user experience, and operational costs.

### Scope and Purpose
- **High-Volume Definition**: Environments processing >10,000 transactions per minute, supporting >1,000 concurrent users, or managing >1TB of active data
- **Business Impact**: 
  - Undersizing: 20-40% performance degradation, 15-30% increase in response times
  - Oversizing: 25-45% unnecessary infrastructure costs
- **Planning Lifecycle**: Assessment → Modeling → Implementation → Monitoring → Optimization

## Key Capacity Planning Principles

### Predictive vs. Reactive Planning
- **Predictive Planning**: 
  - Implement for resources with >4 hour provisioning time
  - Accuracy typically 75-85% for 3-month forecasts, 60-70% for 6-month forecasts
  - Review and adjust quarterly
- **Reactive Planning**:
  - Suitable for resources with <15 minute scale-out capability
  - Requires 40-50% headroom buffer to handle sudden spikes

### Risk Management
- **Capacity Risks Matrix**:

| Risk Category | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Buffer Required |
|---------------|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Sudden traffic spike | Performance degradation | Auto-scaling | 40-50% headroom |
| Service outage | System unavailability | Multi-region deployment | 100% redundancy |
| Seasonal demand | Resource constraints | Scheduled scaling | 25-35% additional capacity |
| Data growth | Storage limitations | Elastic storage | 30% growth buffer |

## Assessment Methodologies

### Workload Analysis
- **Transaction Profiling**:
  - Formula: `Required Capacity = (Peak TPS × Avg. Resource per Transaction × 1.3 safety factor)`
  - Example: 1,000 TPS × 0.05 CPU cores per transaction × 1.3 = 65 cores required
- **User Pattern Identification**:
  - Business hours: 08:00-18:00, typically 60-75% of total daily load
  - Peak hours: 10:00-12:00 and 14:00-16:00, typically 85-95% of maximum capacity
  - Off-hours: 18:00-08:00, typically 10-20% of peak load
- **Quantitative Assessment Techniques**:
  - Percentile analysis: Size for 95th percentile, not average load
  - Time-series analysis: Identify weekly and monthly patterns

### Growth Modeling
- **Linear Growth Model**:
  - Formula: `Future Capacity = Current Capacity × (1 + (Monthly Growth Rate × Forecast Months))`
  - Example: 100GB storage × (1 + (0.05 × 12 months)) = 160GB required after one year
- **Exponential Growth Model**:
  - Formula: `Future Capacity = Current Capacity × (1 + Monthly Growth Rate)^Forecast Months`
  - Example: 100GB storage × (1 + 0.05)^12 = 179GB required after one year
- **Growth Rate Benchmarks**:
  - Steady-state business: 3-5% monthly
  - Growth-phase business: 8-15% monthly
  - Hyper-growth business: 20-30%+ monthly

### Dependency Mapping
- **Resource Dependency Ratios**:

| Primary Resource | Dependent Resource | Typical Ratio |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| vCPU cores | Memory | 1:7 GB |
| Web server instances | Database DTUs | 1:50 |
| Application nodes | Cache memory | 1:5 GB |
| VMs | IOPS | 1:500 |

- **Bottleneck Identification Thresholds**:

| Resource | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | Action Required |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| CPU | 70% sustained | 85% sustained | Scale up/out |
| Memory | 75% sustained | 90% sustained | Scale up |
| Disk throughput | 65% of max | 80% of max | Scale up storage tier |
| Network bandwidth | 60% of max | 75% of max | Increase bandwidth |
| Database DTUs/vCores | 70% sustained | 85% sustained | Scale up DB tier |

## Resource Sizing Guidelines

### Compute Resources
- **VM Size Selection Matrix**:

| Workload Type | Recommended VM Series | Sizing Formula | Example |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|---------|
| Web/API servers | B-series, D-series | `Cores = (Peak RPS × 0.02) + 2` | 500 RPS × 0.02 + 2 = 12 cores |
| Application servers | D-series, F-series | `Cores = (Concurrent Sessions × 0.01) + 4` | 1,000 sessions × 0.01 + 4 = 14 cores |
| Batch processing | E-series, L-series | `Cores = (Data Size in GB × 0.1) + 4` | 100GB × 0.1 + 4 = 14 cores |
| Database | M-series, E-series | `Cores = (QPS × 0.05) + 4` | 200 QPS × 0.05 + 4 = 14 cores |

- **Container Orchestration**:
  - Kubernetes node sizing: `Nodes = (Total pod CPU requests × 1.3) ÷ Node CPU capacity`
  - Example: (100 cores × 1.3) ÷ 8 cores per node = 17 nodes
  - Pod resource request guidelines:
    - CPU: Request at 60% of limit
    - Memory: Request at 80% of limit

- **Serverless Scaling**:
  - Azure Functions: Plan for P99 execution duration, not average
  - Concurrency model: `Instance count = (RPS × P99 Duration in seconds) ÷ 0.8`
  - Example: (100 RPS × 0.3 seconds) ÷ 0.8 = 38 instances

### Storage Planning
- **Storage Account Scaling Limits**:

| Metric | Standard Storage Account Limit | Premium Storage Account Limit | Action When Approaching |
|--------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| IOPS | 20,000 | 100,000 | Distribute across accounts |
| Bandwidth | 50 Gbps | 50 Gbps | Distribute across accounts |
| Capacity | 5 PB | 4 PB | Distribute across accounts |

- **Data Growth Calculation**:
  - Formula: `Storage needs = Current size × (1 + Monthly growth rate)^Planning months × 1.3 buffer`
  - Example: 1TB × (1 + 0.05)^12 × 1.3 = 2.3TB required

- **Tiering Strategy Thresholds**:

| Data Access Pattern | Recommended Tier | Cost Effectiveness Break Point |
|--------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Accessed daily | Hot | Most cost-effective for data accessed > 1-2 times per month |
| Accessed monthly | Cool | Most cost-effective for data accessed < 1 time per month but > 1 time per quarter |
| Accessed quarterly or less | Archive | Most cost-effective for data accessed < 1 time per quarter |

### Network Capacity
- **Bandwidth Planning**:
  - Formula: `Required bandwidth = (Peak concurrent users × Average bandwidth per user × 1.5 safety factor)`
  - Example: 1,000 users × 0.1 Mbps × 1.5 = 150 Mbps
  
- **ExpressRoute Sizing**:

| Monthly Data Transfer | Recommended Circuit Size | Maximum Peak Bandwidth |
|----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| < 10 TB | 50 Mbps | 50 Mbps |
| 10-50 TB | 100 Mbps | 100 Mbps |
| 50-100 TB | 500 Mbps | 500 Mbps |
| 100-500 TB | 1 Gbps | 1 Gbps |
| 500+ TB | 10 Gbps | 10 Gbps |

- **Load Balancer Capacity**:
  - Standard Load Balancer: Up to 1,000 backend instances, 500,000 concurrent flows
  - Application Gateway: Auto-scaling based on traffic patterns
  - Traffic Manager: Global load balancing with 0.3-1.5s failover time

### Database Sizing
- **Azure SQL DTU/vCore Calculation**:
  - DTU formula: `DTUs = (QPS × 0.5) + (Concurrent users × 0.1) + 50 base`
  - vCore formula: `vCores = (QPS × 0.01) + 2 base`
  - Example: 500 QPS system with 200 concurrent users:
    - DTUs = (500 × 0.5) + (200 × 0.1) + 50 = 320 DTUs
    - vCores = (500 × 0.01) + 2 = 7 vCores

- **Cosmos DB RU Calculation**:
  - Read operation: 5-10 RUs per document (1KB size)
  - Write operation: 10-20 RUs per document (1KB size)
  - Formula: `Total RUs = (Read ops per second × Avg. RUs per read) + (Write ops per second × Avg. RUs per write) × 1.5 safety factor`
  - Example: (100 reads/sec × 5 RUs) + (20 writes/sec × 15 RUs) × 1.5 = 1,200 RUs

- **Cache Sizing**:
  - Memory allocation: 30-50% of working dataset size
  - For Redis: `Cache size = (Daily active keys × Average size per key × 1.5 overhead)`
  - Example: 100,000 keys × 2KB × 1.5 = 300MB cache size

## Scaling Strategies

### Vertical Scaling Approaches
- **Vertical Scaling Decision Matrix**:

| Resource | Signs Scale-Up Needed | Recommended Approach | Implementation Method |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| CPU | >70% utilization for 10+ minutes | Increase VM size by one tier | Azure Automation runbook |
| Memory | >80% utilization, high page file activity | Increase VM size by one tier | Azure Automation runbook |
| Disk I/O | >80% of IOPS/throughput limits | Upgrade storage tier | Storage migration script |
| Database | >65% DTU/vCore usage | Increase service tier | Automated scaling script |

- **Vertical Scaling Limitations**:
  - VM scaling requires restart: Plan for 5-10 minutes downtime
  - Maximum instance sizes: Plan workload distribution before reaching upper limits
  - Cost increases non-linearly: Higher tiers have diminishing performance returns

### Horizontal Scaling Frameworks
- **Scaling Trigger Thresholds**:

| Resource | Scale-Out Threshold | Scale-In Threshold | Metrics to Monitor |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Web apps | 70% CPU, 10 second response time | <30% CPU, <100ms response time | CPU, memory, requests/second |
| API services | 60% CPU, >100ms P95 latency | <40% CPU, <50ms P95 latency | CPU, request rate, latency |
| Worker roles | 70% CPU, >50 message queue depth | <30% CPU, <10 message queue depth | CPU, queue depth, processing time |

- **Auto-scaling Configuration**:
  - Scale-out cooldown: 3-5 minutes to prevent thrashing
  - Scale-in cooldown: 10-15 minutes to prevent premature scale-in
  - Increment size: Add 2-3 instances per scale-out action for smoother scaling
  - Pre-warming schedule: Scale to 50% of peak capacity 30 minutes before expected load increase

- **Regional Expansion Strategy**:
  - Traffic Manager routing methods:
    - Performance: <100ms latency requirement
    - Weighted: Gradual regional traffic shifting
    - Priority: Primary/secondary regional setup
    - Geographic: Data sovereignty requirements

### Microservices Scaling
- **Component-Level Scaling**:

| Service Type | Scaling Indicator | Scaling Unit | Scaling Automation |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Frontend services | Request latency, CPU usage | Individual container instances | Kubernetes HPA |
| Processing services | Queue depth, processing time | Pod replicas | KEDA scaled objects |
| Data services | Query latency, connection count | Database replicas, throughput units | Service-specific autoscaling |

- **Service Mesh Considerations**:
  - Control plane sizing: 1 CPU core and 1GB memory per 100 service proxies
  - Data plane overhead: 10-15% additional CPU and memory per service
  - Connection pooling: Set max pool size to `√n × 10` where n is the number of expected concurrent users

- **Traffic Distribution**:
  - Circuit breaker threshold: Open circuit after 5 failures in 10-second window
  - Retry policy: Maximum 3 retries with exponential backoff starting at 100ms
  - Rate limiting: `Rate limit = (Service capacity × 0.8) ÷ Expected consumers`
  - Example: (1000 RPS capacity × 0.8) ÷ 10 consumers = 80 RPS per consumer

## Performance Benchmarking

### Benchmark Design
- **Test Scenario Requirements**:

| Workload Type | Test Duration | Scaling Pattern | Success Criteria |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Steady state | 4-8 hours | Constant load at 70% expected peak | <100ms P95 response time |
| Peak load | 1-2 hours | 100% of expected peak | <500ms P95 response time |
| Spike test | 15-30 minutes | 0-150% sudden increase | No 5xx errors |
| Endurance test | 24-72 hours | Diurnal pattern with 30-80% load | No performance degradation over time |

- **User Simulation Guidelines**:
  - Think time between requests: 3-7 seconds for human user simulation
  - Concurrency model: Virtual user count = `Target RPS × Average session time in seconds`
  - Example: 100 RPS with 5-second session = 500 virtual users

- **Acceptance Criteria Formulas**:
  - Response time: `P95 response time < 500ms`
  - Throughput: `Sustained RPS > Peak RPS × 1.2`
  - Error rate: `Error rate < 0.1% of total requests`
  - Resource utilization: `Peak utilization < 80% of provisioned capacity`
